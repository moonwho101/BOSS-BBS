                         DUNGEON STOMPER INSTRUCTIONS
                         ============================


  Welcome to   the   `THE LAND' and thank you very much for calling.  Dungeon
Stompers is a fantasy adventure  game  written  entirely  in  GW-BASIC.   The
program has been compiled using QUICKBASIC 3.0 by Microsoft.


  The game itself is very simple.   You  log on as  a  stout dwarf,  a clever
halfling or one of the many other characters which are available.     You are
then transported to the dungeon where you will search for riches and  weapons
to build up your strength. But beware,as fierce monsters  and  other  players
lurk in the shadows waiting to attack...


THE BASIC COMMANDS:


DIRECTIONS (Keys: E W N S):  This will enable your  character to  move  about
the dungeon.     There is no  need to  press return  after these  keys.  If a
direction is not displayed in the MOVEMENT listing then there  is a  wall  at
that location and you must go around it.   Moving in any direction  will  use
up one of your turns.


GOLD (Keys: G):  If gold is present in the room or corridor  then you  simply
press the `G' key.  This will make your player pick up the gold.


PICK UP WEAPON OF YOUR CLASS: (Keys: P):  This causes  some  confusion.   You
can only pick up a weapon if it is directly related to your  class  and  race
(exception see MAGIC SCROLLS and MAGIC FIGHTER WEAPONS)  For example, if  you
are a Human Fighter then you may only pick up Human Two Handed Swords.     If
you do try to pick up something that doesn't belong to you, you will  receive
the message `There is no weapon of your class here'.This is how players go up
in status points.  Usually 1/2 a stat point is  given  for  each  weapon  you
find.  It should also be noted that a character  can  pick  up  an  unlimited
number of these items.

PICK UP MAGIC SCROLL (Keys: I):  This is for  Magic-Users  only.    This will
make your character pick up magic scrolls.   Written  on  these  scrolls  are
spells which Magic-Users can cast.


STATS (Keys: T):  This will display your  players  current  status.   It will
display how much gold you have, your strength (stat points), armour and other
important information.


CAST (Keys: C):  This is for Magic-Users only.  This will allow you  charater
to cast one of the spells you have obtained.  A list of spells will be  shown
to  you, simply press the number of the  spell  you  wish to  cast.  Pressing
return will abort spell casting.


BARTER (Keys: B):  This will enable you to Barter with the  old  man  of  the
dungeon.  He must be present in the same room as yourself for  this  to work.
The oldman will offer you an item for a certain amount of gold pieces.    You
can attempt to haggle him down to a more reasonable price.  After 3  refusals
the oldman will leave.  Pressing return will abort bartering.


TELEPORTATION: (Keys: X):   Pressing this key will cause your  player  to  be
teleported to a different area of the dungeon.   This works for both fighters
and magic-users.   If a dungeon area looks bare,  it  is  wise  to  use  this
command as someone  else  has  already  cleaned  the  area  out  before  you.
Teleportation is entirely random... the is no telling where you will end up.


PICK UP A FIGHTER'S MAGIC WEAPON (Key: A):  This will enable fighters to pick
up a certain magical weapon. A special status bonus is given for these items.
Items include Gauntlets and Armour.

FIGHT (Key: F):  This will cause your player to engage in combat with another
player.  The computer will tell you if the other player appears  stronger  or
weaker and then ask if you still wish to fight.  If you  respond  with  `Yes'
then the battle will begin.  The computer picks a luck number and  then  asks
the player to guess it.  If you get it, you automatically  hit your  opponent
causing an above normal amount of damage. If you don't guess it then computer
then looks at both players ARMOUR points and picks a random number  for  each
player  within   there  ARMOUR  limit.    For example,  Slammer  is  fighting
Flavious.  Slammer has   ARMOUR of 10 and Flavious 6.  The computer will pick
a number between 1 and  10 for  Slammer  and a  number  between  1  and 6 for
Flavious. Who ever gets the higher number hits the  other  character  causing
one point of STATUS damage.  The first player to reach 0 is dead.     You are
also given the option of retreating if you are getting slaughtered.


READ MESSAGES (Keys: R):  Pressing this will display any messages to you from
other players.  Use the space bar to pause and `S' to stop.


SEND MESSAGE (Keys: M): Pressing this will allow you to  send  a  message  to
another adventurer.

TALK TO FAERIES (Keys: U): If any Faeries are present, pressing  this  button
will allow you to talk to them.

DRINK POTION (Keys J): This is how characters go up in  ARMOUR  points.  When
a potion is present in a room press this key and your armour will increase by
1/2 points.  Armour is used to HIT other players.

QUITING THE GAME (Keys: Q): If you press this button your game will be  saved
and you will be able to continue where you left off next time you log on.


SPECIAL GAME NOTES:

PITS: When your character encounters a pit the computer will inform you  that
you are teetering on its edge.  You will then have to play  a small  hand-eye
co-ordination game to see if your character falls or not.

TIME:  Your time will be updated once a day.  Your `Moves Made' will  be  set
to zero, as will the number of times you have played.

        1)  One time point deducted for every move you make.
        2)  One half a time point deducted for each melee round.
        3)  Two time points deducted each time you teleport.

Once your Move number is equal to or greater than  your  maximum  moves  your
time is up and you will be automatically logged off.


SPELLS:  It should be noted that  INVISIBILITY and PROTECT SPELLS  last  only
until time updates or when the character logs in again.   Once you log in  or
the time update occurs you are fair game!

INVISIBILITY:   Any character present in the same square as a Magic-User (who
has casted a invisibilty spell)  will become invisible too  as  long  as  the
Magic-User logs off in that square.

LOCATION IN DUNGEON:  The dungeon can be thought of as the forth quadrant  in
a cartesian plain. Your location is given as an  X  and  Y  co-ordinate.  The
easiest way to read the location ( 10 , 5 ) is ; 10 over to the right  and  5
down.

 The most exciting part of the dungeon is the players that  are  in  it.   As
these make up the monsters (however the dungeon master  might  throw  in  the
occasional wandering monster)   You yourself  add that `Spice' and  `Flavour'
which makes the game so popular.  So get new people to join and the game will
be even more exciting!  Form parties and of course, have fun!!!
