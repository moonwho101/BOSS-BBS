Speaking of aids, i heard a new one today.                                                                                                This article in the KW paper cited a study that links old (1950's) poliovaccines with aids viruses in monkeys.  The vaccines were incubated in  monkey kidneys and now they are discovering many monkey viruses in      humans.. not just aids.  They (even Salk, apparently) believe that AIDS was/is a monkey virus that mutated.  The only significant point in this is that they now believe they know how the virus was initially passed   into human beings.  It hasn't brought us closer to an aids vaccine...   which brings us to the next logical question:  What will they incubate  an aids vaccine in?  Does the next plague upon humanity, yet to come,   happen to be an arachnid virus?  Great, just great.. i get to go from   squished spider disease... seriously tho, it does raise questions as to the future repercussions from other vaccine related viruses.                                                                                    (forget this Michaelangelo stuff... human viruses are far more          intrigueing, don't you think?) ... all the more so because you will not find their trigger date.                                                Big hands.. big feet.. big???                                           The guys are snobby, they do not say "hi" to just anyone, you know!     Nope, fresh out.. you caught me in a non-evil mood.  uhm?  Have you     considered just letting it slide and getting on to bigger and better    pursuits?                                                               Uhh hu... well, I'll tell her how to find you... she should be real     pleased about that!                                                     Well, if thats the goal, then cool... but usually when I get my hands ona young (or even a bit older) womans body, I don't want them going to   sleep...                                                                Can't which? Convince him, or look elsewhere?                           Yea, I saw that article about the polio stuff, but I didn't read it for the details. I am not very knowledgable on these human viruses... nor amI on the computer viruses. I tend to think that alot of it is overblown.Especially this Micheal Angelo thing... a big scam to sell beckup       software, and anti-virus software...                                    heart?

(now i could be wrong and someone  will probably say that's where they met the love of their life, but i   find that at the bar people are there for a fling)                      oh well excuse moi!                                                     but they try to be sociable now and then, don't they?  they do get out, right??

I think they just dropped the "tra" inlater versions to save face.

I think when you write sentences like this, you shouldn't criticize     someone when they misspell 'derivative' especially when, from           look of it, he made a typo and not a spelling error.                                                                                            As for the mistakes in post:                                                                                                                    "thats" should be capitalized.                                          "Thats" should be singular.                                             "Cant" refers to trade jargon, you should have used "can't".                                                                                    And if you really want to get picky, it should have been:                                                                                       "Is that why you can't spell?" instead of "That is..." --                                                                                                                                     Justin                                                                                            Re: Monkey virus...                                                                                                                             That's amusing.  You'd think that doctors and such would know better    than to inject people with material from other animals, after the large number of viruses that have already crossed over from animals to humans already -- and how devestating new viruses have been to certain         population groups (small pox in North America, black plague in Europe).                                                                         I think the list of animals which have transmitted viruses to humans    includes all of the following: pigs, rats, monkeys, and cows.  Probably there are tons more.

Unless you are one inflicted with one of the  viruses.                                                                                                                                        I very, very often wonder if many "cures" or vaccines have been         discoverd to combat certain diseases, but are locked away in the file   drawers of the drug companies.  Like the computer viruses cause a surge in sales of scanners, software, etc, it is my belief that many research projects are hampered by the drug companies in order that they may      continue to sell pain or symptom relieving medicines, without actually  curing the symptoms altogether.                                                                                                                 I realise this is a very cynical view, however, i believe it to be      possible, if not probable.                                              re: Quickbasic parameter passing....                                                                                                            QB can pass parameters in a number of ways but is unable to receive datain any form other than near reference.  References to C routines can be made in QB programs, e.g.  DECLARE SUB Cprog CDECL().  References to    BASIC functions in C should be prototyped as _fortran.                                                                                          Here is an example (from the Microsoft C Advanced Programming Techniquesmanual):                                                                                                                                        BASIC SOURCE:                                                                                                                                   DEFINT A-Z                                                              DECLARE SUB Cprog CDECL()                                               CALL Cprog                                                              END                                                                     FUNCTION Dbl(N) STATIC                                                    Dbl=N*2                                                               END FUNCTION                                                            SUB Printnum(A,B) STATIC                                                  PRINT "The first number is ";A                                          PRINT "The second number is ";B                                       END SUB                                                                                                                                         C SOURCE:                                                                                                                                       int _fortran dbl(int _near *);                                          void _fortran printnum(int _near *,int _near *);                                                                                                void cprog()                                                            {                                                                         int a=5;                                                                int b=6;                                                                printf("%d times 2 is %d\n",a,dbl(&a));                                 printnum(&a,&b);                                                      }                                                                                                                                               This example, while useless, does illustrate some of the techniques     involved.  Since I do not program in QB, I can only be of limited       assistance on that side, however, I can answer any questions you might  have from the C side of things.

There   was also and Alex Paris on the f-ball team at that time.  He's a little taller than I and is a mullato, I am about 5'7 1/2" and white.

No threat... well, not really... but if you did slip me some of that    salt peter stuff, I don't think she'd have been real happy about it...  Foreplay can only last so long, and you've got to get on to the         details...                                                              Why not dive in head first! Go nuts, I will trust (bug mistake) you're  judgement...                                                            Define old. The girl I'm seeing now has 13 years on me...               Oh, I believe virisuses exist, and can be dangerous. Just not as bad as everyone seems to think.                                                Thank you. Thank you. Head from the class did you say??                 No, you may not sit on my hand.. you didn't even say sorry, either.     What a big meanie.

Ah, true.. but... uhm, i wear it well?                                                                                                          btw!!!  you owe me five bucks.

Ever hear of fever blisters?  ouch.                                       Thanx a lot. I suspected that a memory block of 64K would be at a     paragraph boundary because I tested this myself, but wasn't sure if it  would always be so. I needed it to load the C/MS voice driver (it HAS tostart at address 0 of a segment), but I already found out how to        read/write the voice input/ouput ports of the soundblaster without it.  (Just disassembled the whole ^%#*&$ thing).                               Now try to explain this to a fanatic... Good luck!                      No, not quite. I do not do ANY illegal drugs anymore... I just can't  spell period; no specific reeson... (grin)                              Thanks for the programming example.  I looked it over quickly and       captured it.  I'll let you know if I'm having problems.  I don't programin QB either, but I'm doing this for an associate who'll be able to tellme in very definite terms whether what I'm doing works!                                                                                                                                         Andy Stedman            Who said anything about minor? I told you she was over 18...            Hmm... well, I prefer experience to niavte any day... I don't like the  stupid mind games...                                                    Fever blisters? Nope, sorry...                                          i did so!  she was hollaring too loud for you to hear.                  i don't want to rain on your parade, but maybe there isn't...           i kept taking my ex back on and off for three years!  and as i look backwe didn't have anything really, sad to say.  but i hope that you two    work it out and all goes well.                                          sometimes i do...                                                       sometimes i don't...

Can anybody tell me how to program the DMA chips????                  Well your not the guy if it was 6 years ago !  I know Alex, but I think he has an attitude just like SYSOP !  Well, i'll have to check my       yerabook !                                                              Oh no !  The cookie monster invades my little world !  What's next ???  Well, who else is there !  Nobody else but Kelly knows where I live !   Not lately, but if your around in the parking lot, I am sure I will !   Well Dianne, seeing as you are an avid Blue Jay Fan, I must say that    they are STUPID for starting JACK MORRIS in the season opener, and      JIMMIE KEY in the home opener !  The guy who should be pitching both    games should be DAVE STIEB !   The only guy to throw a no-hitter, the   record holder for most wins, most wins in a season, most strikeouts in  the Majors, most complete games, lowest ERA over 10 years.......        Need I say more ????????  Any comments on this devastating and abissmal turn of events !

I have a 44 waist (was down to 42, even 41 once,  but...                                                                  Would anybody here be able to tell me how to program one of the timer   chips to get an interrupt 13,000 times per second?                      re: high res timing...                                                                                                                          On an AT or better, I can tell you how to get 1024 Hz interrupts but no better.  What do you need such high resolution for?

If it is KASACOUS, I am the only Alex KASACOUS that has ever attended   GCI, and likely the only one that ever will.                            "Where does he get those wonderful toys,"  One of the best lines from   the first of the Batman Trillogy released last summer.  Nicholson's rolecarried much of the film which I did enjoy emmensly.  What I want to    know is: with Batman ][ coming out this summer will the villans or will there actually be some character development of Batman.  He was created to be a fixed personality but the series will go downhill (even with allthe great F/X) if the series relies only on the villians, not the main  character.                                                                                                                                          Dave                                                                Is it me or is everyone beginning to add in little bits of RAP into     their music.  Michael Jackson it the Perfect example, not that I don't  like all of his music, in fact I do like a fair bit of it but first of  all it's added in bits or RAP to keep try to appeal to a wider group of people and then also, how many videos do you think it will be until the boy is completely white?  Every video his skin has gone a few shades    lighter and he's now at tanned oriental...I don't think I discriminate  between races but it's usually nice to know that people are one race andSTAY one race.                                                                                                                                     Dave                                                                 Good album but the tape users are getting ripped off.  the people with  CD's have a hidden track after the end of the last track which I haven'theard yet but what do you guys think of the possibilities for hiding    extra songs or information on CD's...It would be weasy to distribute andonly accessable to a very few with the knowledge on how to get to it    and where it is.                                                                                                                                   Dave                                                                 In today's age of technology, we have the ability to store and hide     information.  One of the best examples is the CD...They've started now  making CD's with addition songs hidden on the (see the message I left inthe music area)  but the point is that very few people know of the      existance of such technology never mind trying to look for it.  How     likely do you think it is that information is hidden on other disks thatare not looked for and is better disguised or innaccessable by regular  means....It's possible that there are state secrets are stored on       regular CD's that can be bought and passed around easily, but only      accessed by those with special knowledge and where it works.                                                                                        Dave                                                                Well Sultan ...lets you and I fire all coaching staff of the Blue Jays  and take over....then the Jays will go all the way for sure...          I think they sould get rid of Key altogether...and start Guszman (sp?)  Now he is going to be one  hell of a good pitcher...                    You are right though ..Stieb should be one of the starters ...I can't   figure out their strategies sometimes...very frustrating....            April 6... can't wait ...I am all pumped up ...got my Lucky Blue Jay    Shirt and banner...Go Jays Go !!!!                                      Opinions of Wayne's World?  Has anyone seen it.  I wasn't personally    thrilled about it.  Too much hype!  It had some funny lines.  Anyone?   Anyone?                                                                 Well I guess your not him then !  Am I right or what ???                I'd heard that's it's pretty funny but to wait to go and see it on a    Tuesday.  (It's funny but not enough to pay full price.)                                                                                        Well -- I'm not from BC, but I lived in Vancouver for a year.           I don't remember any Kokanee commercials mentioning "mugwumps" --       I just remember them with that dog, "Brew" --                                                                                                   And I remember Kokanee commercials with Kokanees jumping up the river tospawn, like salmon, set to Beethovens 9th.                                                                                                      What part of BC are you from?                                                                                                                                                                     Justin                                                                                        Anything's possible --                                                                                                                          I imagine that's probably true for the "minor" afflictions that people  suffer from.  I don't know if it would be true so much of the major     things.                                                                                                                                         They probably have better remedies for things like heartburn, arthritis,and such things which they don't market because they can sell a lot of  products for these things.                                                                                                                      But I think if someone hit upon a cure for a major disease there would  be several factors pressuring them to make it public:                                                                                           (1) If someone else figures it out, then they lose out on it            (2) They can control the sale of it for decades and be the                   only distributor of the product, raking in a fortune                    (imagine if you had a cure for cancer, and had it under                 patent -- then everyone had to buy it from you, at what                 price you felt like charging)                                      (3) It would make their name prestigious, and their other                    products would then sell well too                                                                                                          However, none of this is so true with the smaller afflictions.  They maywell have better remedies for the common cold, etc., and not release    them, because the market is so huge.                                                                                                                                                                     Justin                                                                                 Batman was a bad movie.  It would have been a complete waste of time hadit not been for J.Nicholson --                                                                                                                  That made it only a partial waste of time.                                                                                                      It was all hype and no substance.  Typical of the crud that comes out ofHollywood these days -- there was nothing really good about that movie  at all, it made a fortune for one reason, and one reason only:                                                                                  Advertising.                                                                                                                                    Giving it "stars" for it's worth, it probably deserves 2 -- and the     second only because of Nicholson.                                                                                                                                                                      Justin                                                                                   There are lots of things you can do with CD's, and hiding tracks at the end is nothing original to Nirvana.                                                                                                             There are other interesting things that can be done with CD's as        well:                                                                                                                                           (1) Endless repeating segment at the end                                (2) Make collectors items by putting a sticker on the back of               the CD that must be removed in order to play the last track             (how many people could resist peeling off the sticker just              to listen to that last track once?  Would become a collectors           item rapidly -- copies with the sticker still on them, that             is)                                                                 (3) Punch holes in the CD to make it skip in weird and                      wonderful ways                                                                                                                              Another trick that bands sometimes do is make the entire CD one long    track.  When CD's first hit the market in a big way, Prince got upset   with the idea that his fans could skip over songs they didn't like, so  he made the entire Lovesexy album a single track, so they would have to listen to the whole thing.                                                                                                                      Front 242 also hid stuff at the end of the CD.  Two bonus tracks that   appear after 2 minutes of silence at the end of the last track.                                                                                 (On the Tyranny for You CD).                                                                                                                                                                      Justin                                                                                        Another possibility is a CD with a track on the "wrong" side --         ie: that you had to put in upside down to hear.                                                                                                 How many people would think of trying their CD upside down?                                                                                     All it would take is an inconspicuous little blank section at the centreof the CD, wide enough for one track (CD's play from the inside out) --                                                                                                                            Justin                                                                                       Probably was the snake.                                                                                                                         Oh well -- it's nice to know that teenage pregnancy isn't just a recent problem.  Glad to see that Christians were having trouble with this one even 2000 years ago --                                                                                                                          Think they'd have learned something by now, but I guess they don't like to tell their kids about sex before they get married.                                                                                                                                             Justin                Personally, although I can see the little character development and all that stuff, I did like the first movie.  This one looks like it's going to be at least of equal quality (although some would say it's hard to   sink lower than the last) and besides, again they have two well         established actors in their prime playing the villans.                                                                                          Dave                                                                    A few other neat items with CD's...                                     The BBS made the doctor who soundtrack a square CD (definatly a         collector's item.                                                       Some of the older CD's are indexed, like tracks within tracks,          unfortunatly they don't do it too often any more and finding a player   with the feature is even less likely.                                                                                                           DAve                                                                    Actually I've tried it on several occasions and there was usually not   too much to listen to on the other side of a CD...I'm waiting for them  to start that though.  Just put a label around the outside of the DIsk  and the make both sides playable.                                                                                                               Dave                                                                    Here's a small tidbit for anyone interested...In our world their is a   growing danger of an unstoppable greenhouse effect caused in a large    part by Carbon di/Mon oxide in the air.  A large portion of this comes  from cars and trucks...Woudln't you think that it would be a good idea  to find a new method of probulsion to save our world...                                                                                            But here's where it gets interesting... On three seperate occasions, a Car engine has been perfected that would run on water...Using         Electrolosis to seperate the water into hydrogen and oxygen then        exploding them (as they are in the perfect mixture already) which       results in only water as a final product, much of which can be re-used. Therefore you have a car which is cheaper to run (it runs off water) it needs less fuel stops (3/4 of the fule can be re-used each time *that's a guess)) and it saves the planet (supposidly)  This car seems to be theanswer to many problems but the hitch is that on each occasion when the patent has come up for sale, it has been bought by a country that       produces oil or gas and they promptly hide them to further the sales of their product.                                                                                                                                     Dave                                                                 re: Batman                                                                                                                                      I have to disagree... I think it was an excellent movie... exactly what is was supposed to be... A comic book on the screen... (excuse the ..., bad habit)                                                              re: Water engine patent bought and hidden                                                                                                       Although I am not suggesting that this couldn't happen, it sounds to me like an 'Urban Myth'. Much like the tanning ones we talked about some   time ago... I heard another one yesterday. This guy was on a beach down south. (Mexico, or some such place) He fell asleep on the beach. While  he was sleeping, a spider bit him on the forehead. About a month later, back home, he was on his way to the doctors to see about this bump on   his head, when it broke open, and ton's of baby spiders poured out.     Apparently the spider that bit him had laid eggs there. Supposedly, a   'friend of a friend' was there when it happened.                        what's next you ask?  how about a visit from elmo???                    i know where you work, i know  where you live, i know where you eat...  the commercials are before the ones you mentioned...bill reiter was     dressed up as the sasquach and there were a whole series of them, and inone he had his "wife" on and referred to her as mugwump. (there were    even t shirts with it on)                                               i am from richmond, lived there for close to 18 years, we moved there   when it was just a farming community and now it is a booming city, we   visited two summers ago and even being away for two years it sure has   grown!                                                                  not inseam...what!!                                                     How do you know all these things !  Who told you I eat in the bathroom  ????  <blush> !  Who is Elmo ??                                         Well Dianne, i think your right !  Let's fire those good for nothing    tide wads and really build a winner !  Yes, Key is a waste of human     flesh isn't he and Guzman is gonna be some pitcher !  He throws         fireballs  !  They are speed demons for sure !  Ofcourse, i'm right whenit comes to stieb !  He is the MAN that has started 7 all-star games andstill only opened 5 seasons for them !  How dusgusting !  What's April  6th ????? Oh opening day , yes, should be good !  Shirt and banner,     where's the rest of the clothing ???                                      Well, it is an "AT or better"... I want to do it on a 386. Anyways, I need a 13000 (12898) Hertz interrupt to sample an incoming analogue     signal while having the computer do something useful when the signal is being converted. I'm using the soundblaster voice input, which needs    about 77.53 microseconds to convert the signal to a digital value, but  simply reading the "data available" port and the data itself when it's  ready takes a lot less than that. Since I'm also going to do a lot of   processing on the signal, I thought if I could have an interrupt driven routine to read it, I should be able to start processing the sample     while it is being read in. It's probably better still to use a DMA      channel to read in the sample, but I don't know where to find the info  on how to program the DMA chips. BTW, you don't happen to know an easierthan usual way to do a Fourier analysis, do you? Or another way to      seperate the low and high frequencies from a given signal, divided up   into about 20 bands?                                                    What two actors are playing the villains?  Sorry, but I haven't been up on my movie review reading.                                             PS- I didn't like the first one either.  Kim Bassigner was a dud.  Is   she in the second one?                                                  There aren't many movies that are worth full price anymore.  Except     "Beauty and the Beast".  I saw it last weekend.  I brought my little    cousin. (payed half price for matinee) but I loved it so much I am goingwith my friend tonight.                                                 Danny Devito and Michelle Phipher(I know that's not how it's spelt and  I'm not sure but I think it's her) are the villans and to the best of myknowledge Kim isn't in this film.                                                                                                               From what I hear it's suppoesed to be really good,  I haven't been to   see it yet but I do plan on it...I think I may spend a large portion of my summer sitting with a VCR catching up.                                                                                                       Interesting Trivia: You know the ballroom scene where Beauty and the    beast are dancing?  None of that was drawn...it was entirely a computer animation, as were all the spaceships in "The Last StarFighter" using a system that was originally developed to be used in the Star Wars Series and wasn't...How long do you think it will be until they have a whole   movie using only computer animation?                                    >   his head, when it broke open, and ton's of baby spiders pour        >   Apparently the spider that bit him had laid eggs there.

I heard a similar tale...Except that the spider crawled up the victim's nose and laid eggs.  Instead of having a bump the spiders hatched and   she went mad because they began to feed at the inside of her scull.     I know windows can be sped up by using RamDrive but I have a problem    that I only have 4 Meg, If I use a 1Meg Ramdisk then it doesn't all fit but If I try a 2 Meg disk then I don't have enough memory to Flip       Betweem Windows and Telemate (The only reason that I really want to     Multi-task is to do something else while I download and I can't because windows won't give enought time to telemate when downloading and I get  plenty of errrors so the point where it will abort transfers.                                                                                   I'm running with a 385-SX (I think, I need to find a program to check   the acutal speed, I can't use my Norton or Pctools because the versions I have are old and don't like DOS 5's Hard Drive Format.)               re: soundblaster sampling                                                                                                                       Does the soundblaster generate an interrupt while sampling?  This whole problem would be trivial if it were.                                                                                                            re: Fourier Transforms                                                                                                                          Do you know how to do FFTs?

HEY!                                                                    i just read the lawnmower man (again it's been a LONG time) and yes     indeed it has nothing to do with the movie...i forgot just how strange  it was.  dude needs his lawn cut, calls a place, buddy comes over to do the job, takes off all his clothes, follows the mower and eats the      grass, run over a mole (or some kind of critter) eats that too!  dude   calls the cops, lawnmower chases after him, dude is dead.  oh forgot,   the pan man was buddy's boss...

Hey I am a true Jays fan all you need is a shirt and banner....the rest of the clothing is opitional ...if you know what I mean.....so my littlelover boy what are you going to be wearing that night??????             Please wear thae same outfit you wore on Saturday night????                           Love ,                                                                   Lady Di                                                    No, as far as I know, the soundblaster does not need an interrupt     while sampling, although it might (not sure about this) generate an     interrupt when the data buffer is ready for a new character when doing  voice output. As FFT: no, I do not have the algorithm. I was hoping the Davis centre library would have some info on it, but if you'd be willingto post it: please do so!

Jossie     better watch it, cuz chris lloks like the type to put her lights out !  I have hot dogs in the bathroom and sometimes even sasauges ??? Ewwww   Hi Moz... Sorry I took so long to get back to you, bin real busy of latewith the end of year at work.                                                                                                                     I know what you mean about the music. I guess that's why I like jazz  so much, so little of it is cluttered up with lyrics.  I just but 3 or  four discs in the CD player and let it go.                                Found an old record of John Coltrane's called ASCENSION in a store theother day. Near mint condition.  Love it.                                                                                                         Later ....Dennis                                                      re:  RCMP analogy and the church                                                                                                                  Sorry it took so long to answer you, but we had the end of year audit at work and it's taken up a lot of my time.                                                                                                       I can understand your aprehension. It was one of the things that      contributed to my leaving the church in the formal semse.  That is to   say while I don,t attend any longer I have not abandoned my belief in   God by any means.  But I won.t get into that at this point.               The point made in the analogy is designed to keep the members from    exploring other areas of thought.  They teach that you don't have to    study others peoples ideas to recognize your own, which I guess is a    valid point, but the reason for the analogy is that if a follower reads nothing but the scriptures and commentary publications that support the particular denominations point of view then you never have to worry     about your sheep coming to any conclusions other than the ones you feed them.                                                                     I have no real problem with the analogy; just it's application.  As I said this kind of thinking is one of the reasons you rarely see me in   church any more.                                                                                                                                   Later......Dennis                                                    Hi Justin sorry I took so long getting back to you, end of year at work is bogging me down.  We still do inventory and audits manually so it    seems to take forever.  One of these days the outfit I work for will    join the rest of us in the 20th century, but probably not until the     21st.                                                                                                                                             As I mentioned in a message to Sylvia, there is a dark side to this   kind of thinking, as there is to most everything in this world.  The    church tends to use the analogy in question to prevent followers from   pursuing areas of study that are not "in the best interests of the      Gospel."  It's a proven fact that the less a person is exposed to       original thinking the less likely they are to engage in the activity    themselves.  It was this kind of mind-numbing pap that led to my gettingout in the first place.                                                                                                                           Later......Dennis                                                     actually he enjoys singing the elmo song to her, she gets a real kick   out of it...                                                            as for hot dogs...well i have no comment...i think i have to go blow    chunks now!                                                             ok ok ok                                                                Justin, first you stated that people will act the same as their         predecessors. You also state that you have no morals. That would make   you an amoral person. Not immoral but amoral. An amoral person cannot   tell the difference between good or bad. He doesn't accept that anythingis good or bad. It merely is. Is this a fair description of you? And areyou this way because your parents were this way? To judge something as  good or bad is to make a moral judgement. Obviously, you don't make     those types of judgements. People exist. You exist. Your interactions   are not colored by any moral judgements because you are amoral and are  unable to distinguish between good and bad.                                                                                                     Or, is it that you refuse to do your part as a member of society? Your  job is to see that the whole survives and you must do this by making,   at times, moral judgements. If you are called as a juror you must rendera moral judgement. Remember, morals are based solely on the concept of  good and bad behaviour. Are you capable of doing this? Or are you a     dysfunctional person who has no contribution to make to society? A      society that idolizes virtues and represses vices.                      Elmo?  I love elmo.  Sesame Street wouldn't be the same without him!    Yeah, I heard that it was computer animated.  Have you seen it?  I      remember thinking at that part how real everything looked.  It was      amazing.  It would have been a great movie, even without the wonderful  animation.  I'm probably going to see it again this week.  I'm hooked!   i trust her now, but she doesn't think that.  things are fairly        confusing now, but i have a feeling the worst is going to happen.       i figure i'm in the lap of fate now.  know anyone out there willing to  put me out of my misery?  i would leave them all my worldy              possessions...                                                                                                                                  Re: Your evaluation of me: amoral, no good vs. bad, etc.                                                                                        Correct.                                                                                                                                        Re: Was this because my parents were this way?                                                                                                  No.  My parents are moralistic.  Moderately so.  I come from a fairly   average background.  My parents were neither extremely religious nor    non-religious.                                                                                                                                  Re: Is it because I don't want to do my part in society                                                                                         I intend to do my part in society because it is advantageous for me to  do so.  Not because it is "good" or "bad" but rather because it will    enable me to eat, and do as I please.  Were I not to do my part in      society, I would quickly find it difficult to go about doing the things I want to go about doing.                                                                                                                       Re: If I am called on to be a juror I will be required to give              moral judgements                                                                                                                            No.  I will be required to give legal judgements.  I will be required tosay things like: "Given what I have heard, it is my judgement that the  events described by the prosecution did in fact occur."  Or: "I have notfound the prosecutions arguments sufficiently compelling.  It seems to  me that there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the events actually   occurred the way the prosecution suggests they did."                                                                                            There is nothing moral in this.  A jury is required to turn in a verdictof "true" or "false" as to whether or not a set of events actually took place, where those events constitute a crime under the legal code of    Canada.  Hence: "Does the jury believe, true or false, that so-and-so   murdered so-and-so" --                                                                                                                          The jury does not proclaim murder immoral -- rather it merely states    that it occurred, or did not occur.                                                                                                                                                                                     Justin                                                                                                                                          Comic books are more interesting than the Batman movie was.                                                                                     "Comic book on the screen" is a correct analogy only if by "comic book" you mean the sort of drivel put out by DC and friends.                                                                                          Real comics -- Pirahna Press, Urania 235, and all that... much better.

Well I successfully avoided Richmond for the entire time I was in BC.   Managed to stay away from Surrey too (I heard too many jokes and got    really scared of Surrey girls).                                                                                                                 In fact, for being there for a year I was only in a suprisingly small   number of places.  Nanaimo.. Victoria.. and I lived in Vancouver.       Except for passing through, I don't think I really ever spent any       significant amount of time anywhere else (counting Burnaby as part of   Vancouver).                                                                                                                                     How long ago did you move out here?  Why did you move out here?                                                                                 I had to move back here because I'm in school, and sooner or later I    actually do have to get that degree and get on with my life.  If I had  had more of a choice, I wouldn't have come back.                                                                                                                                                       Justin           i agree totally, he should even have his own show he's so cool!  he was on a cooking show last week was it ever funny! we were rolling on the   floor laughing so hard, the guy didn't really know how to take him, it  was a scream!                                                           there's nothing much wrong with richmond, except it's far too built up  and it's a waste of farmland!  surrey, yes i can see you staying away   from there!! as in the old joke what's the difference between surrey    girls and a pink caddilac?  not everyone has been in a pink caddilac!   i moved to bc when i was four (from hawaii where i was born) and lived  there until two and a half years ago...why did i move here?  temporary  insanity i guess!!  i miss the coast most of the time, the ocean, REAL  mountains and the general attitude of people.  it's a totally different way of life here don't you think?  maybe one day i will move back, or   maybe i will move to maine which is my second love!                     Brian Mulroney really is a nice guy he just played to much football withhis helmet off                                                          what is the difference between a savings bond and a man???              a savings bond   matures                                                Re: Elmo                                                                                                                                        Well, I wouldn't think Chris liked kids, but hark i guess i'm wrong !

No, everyone playing mind games is called life!                         you could be refering to Alex Sharpe.  I think that he might be at GCI. If the alex you know, also knows you, then ... I have no idea who you   are, so therfore I am not the person you know.

Every cloud has a silver lining.                                        (gag gag) Sorry I tried!                                                                                                                        different way of life --                                                                                                                        Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call it a different way of life.  I    would call it more tense though.  The same way of life but more tense   than it is out West.                                                                                                                            Then again, the level of tension can make all the difference sometimes.                                                                                                                              Justin             well, i do have faith that things will get better eventually.  the      problem is, how long do i have to wait before i see that light?  untill i see a sign, i live in hell....                                        the fact that i am one of the many unemployed folks gives me lots of    time to watch elmo in action!  actually we don't really watch it very   often, only when we catch emlo doing his thing!!                        well i think that it is a different was all together...it was kind of   like entering the twilight zone...i kid you not, that's exactally how i felt the first few months i was here.  and yes it is a much faster pace back east!

Yes... but some people don't even realise they are playing in the games until they are on the losing end of the score board.                    DON't do it.... IT'S A TRAP!!!!                                         Nah, I revise my origional definition.. mind games are neither life, or courting.... it's called politics.                                      In Kim's case $5 was worth five minutes of silence.                       Please ignore my question about doing a Fourier analysis: I just foundit in one of my old calculus books...

Hey when you are as old as I am you have to have a one track mind...It  gets too complicated otherwise....

I attributed it mostly to not having a clue where I was going or what I was doing.  When I decidedto take a year off school I flipped a coin.  I got heads so I went West.I went to Calgary first, but didn't think much of it.  Then I went to   Edmonton, and hung around there for not more than a day and a night.    Eventually I ended up in Vancouver, and managed to get a job working at Central Guaranty Trust.  I stayed there for a year --                                                                                           But it was weird arriving there because I knew no-one, I had never been there before, and I had no idea where I was going to go, or what I was  going to do.                                                                                                                                    But it was different I guess as well.  People in the West were a little more relaxed, but also a little bit more detached.  People are more openin the West, but they're also less committed.  A lot are a little bit   weird in the head too -- but only a little.  All in all people seem the same everywhere.                                                                                                                                                                                           Justin                                                                               You might be interested to know that electric cars are on the way.      Ford Motor company already has several electric models on the American  market (they cost about $5000 US more than the equivalent gas models)   and the other major American car manufacturers are scheduled to         introduce electric cars of their own over the next few years --                                                                                 They don't get incredible amounts of speed, etc., but they do perform   well enough for highway driving and such.                                                                                                       And anyways, exactly why would someone want a car that can go           0 - 200kmph in 60 second?                                                                                                                                                                              Justin           Well, you mean to say your a senile old woman ???  Is this correct ??   Oh, Blue Jays, shmew Jays... I hate to tell you deary, but they ain't   gonna win it this year !   Just something about the team I don't like ! So, the T-shirt, I should have noticed there was something there for a  change !!!!!!!

Al ot  of people wont like that. Namely  Don Cherry!                                            S.L.

Come on you haven't given up on the Jays already ...don't get them mixedup with those loser Make Me Laughs (Maple Leafs)                        You are just pissed off because Steib isn't pitching yet....hey they arejust saving the best for last...                                        Are there no other Blue Jay Fans out there ...come on somebody          Anybody......????                                                       Well, your right, I am pissed cause stieb isn't there. But you are      right, that save the best till last !  Anyways' the LEAFS rule !!!!     Are you getting tired of me ??????  You seemed a little gunshy last     night before we hit the sack ????                                       a trap?  how so?  i've known her for some quite time, and i don't think she would turn around on me suddenly and go after someone else, though  i'm not 100% sure.  was with her on tues. nite at fairview mall, and    things went pretty well, and i figure it's just a question of time.     still, i know not what the next few weeks hold in store for me.......   I'm looking for any program(s) that will assist with Lighting and       Lighting Re-design. Basically i'm looking for something that will help  with Wattages of bulbs and ballasts, and all sorts of neat stuff so if  anybody knows where i could find such a program(s) please tell me.

My brother got hit, 4 of his friends got hit, 50% of the systems in his highschool got hit. Hell, even one of my computers my brother used for 10 minutes got hit...Last time he gets to copy any software to it!                           Sure they can be politics.  Cocktail diplomacy.                         Oh relax!  I was just generalizing about relationships, in general.     I am scared. With an attitude like that, no wonder you like the habs !  I, personally like the leafs, a good team, which might actually make theplayoffs. Not some group of scabs that have a gay coach.                Sounds good to me!  You'll have to let me know when elmo "does his      thing" so that I can catch him in action!                               Well Steve, I can't tell you when things will turn around (since I don'teven know what the problem is) but you're right, eventually things will get better.  I'm here for you!

Great idea...use a pitcher that has not fully recovered from rotator  cuff surgery and win the first game.  Too bad you will probably ruin hisarm for the rest of the season and his career. But what the hey that    opener is worth ruining a life don't you think?

I was at GCI last in 1987.  I  think you might see me in a couple of pictures in that yearbook, and I  am sure we have never met.  If you go to GCI at this time, you could    hide Mr. Hardy's briefcase for me and in a couple of days, just tell    him that I did it.

Well, at least that's a novel way of making a few bucks (and almost honest too!)

It kept crashing windows and I would have to reboot.  I use com  port 3 with an internal modem.  I have a book here called Windows 3     Secrets published by InfoWorld.  The guy who wrote it says with 4 megs, you should have a ram drive of 512k and set your TEMP=(ramdrive) in yourconfig.sys file.  I found that using Procomm under windows slows my     uploading and downloading about 25-30%.  Maybe 3.1 will be better.  I   just got the upgrade offer in the mail today.                                                                                                        Hope that helps.                                                                                                                           P.S.  If you think your system is slow, try using Norton Desktop.  My   386/33 takes 2 minutes from the time I type: WIN :                                                                                              Greg Moore                                                              Yeah, I did cheap a bit.... does giggling count?                        O.K. also, I'm having a lot of trouble with Zmodem...I just upgraded to Telemate 3.01 and I've been having a lot of trouble with lots of errors and occasional aborts...Any Ideas how to fix it?                                                                                                Dave                                                                    I suppose that it's nice to know the extra power is there. With an      electric car, the main reason for limited success in the past has been alack of battery capacity...Do you know if they've improved the capacity to make a real produciton model?                                        Coctail Diplomacy?  I don't know...From my experiance, a lot of the timethe only time diplomacy in general (And diplomats in particular) make   sense is after a few cocktails.                                         Didn't know that they'd be European's considering that is somewhat of a trend right now, so that does make alot of sense that they would have   more of them coming into the NHL. Hopefully there won't be a player's   strike it would make this season seem senseless if they were to strike, not to mention besides losing lots of cash, alot of people would be     pretty upset if there were no playoffs and that in turn could have a    negative effect possibly.                                               Exactly!  You catch on quickly.  Those of us who don't play head games  only understand those who do after several stiff drinks.                                                                                        They have real production models.  Sort of.  They're actually converted gas models.  If you have $5000 US to spare, you can buy several of the  Ford cars and have it converted, by Ford, to an electric.                                                                                       I don't know the details beyond that.  I do know two things though:                                                                             (1) If electric cars do go into production, then the technology will        improve rapidly.  Look how fast gas-engine tech. took off after         gas engines went into mass production.                                                                                                      (2) The car manufacturers are starting to get into the idea, whereas        before they were opposed to it.  Obviously the oil companies            are still opposed to electric cars -- but at least now the              car manufacturers are willing to try it out.                                                                                                                                                   Justin               Ok, will do that !  Actually, i never liked him, if you were a girl,    that was fine but otherwise he was an ass !  Well, I'm not going there, but i'll still see if I have an 878 yeabook !                           Hey, HABS really SUCK !!!!!!                                            Oil companies shouldn't object too much to an electric switch over...oilwill still be neaded, it's the gas companies that will kick up a stink. On the contrary,  I like to try to play head games, and I can usually   follow most of them (even without drinking) but diplomats and people in politics are hard to follow simply because they try (some of the time)  to do what they said they were going to do, as well was what they want  to do and several hidden agendas that we have no idea what they are.    That's why they only make sense when you're drunk.  Then you can pick upon a simplistic line of reasoning and not worry about all the subtiltiesof the other goals he/she/they might have.                              well how do YOU like 'em?? boiled? baked? sauteed? or RAW?              chunks are chunks...                                                    i just don't want to be around to see it!                               I encountered a ream of info on the DMA chips while browsing the Ilink CConf.  I don't know how accurate or useful the information is, because  there seemed to be countless questions being asked everywhere about the code provided (it seemed to have errors--I'm not sure), but it might be of some help.  Would you like me to upload it, or place it in a message?                                                                                                                        Andy Stedman            Well I prefer them sauteed !  They are more nutricious that way ! What  kind is preferred at the Jungle !                                       I'm noticing that people who like using computer languages develop or   maybe are naturally inclined towards understanding languages, and have a"feel" for syntactical relations.  Programming seems to enable          terse, complex, and suggestive use of lanaguage.  It seems to me that   there are similarities between the aesthetics of poetry and the logic ofprogramming.  Am I dreaming ? does this make sense to anybody ?                                                                                 I don't know about programmers being inclined toward language --        ever try reading the sort of documentation programmers themselves       usually produce?  I mean documentation NOT written by hired English     students by companies like Wordperfect --                                                                                                       Usually it's full of all kinds of stylistic blunders and                incomprehensible grammer.                                                                                                                       I'm a programmer, and I'm inclined toward language -- and perhaps in a  University town like Waterloo or Guelph it might just be that the       programmers who are around also have higher educations, and that is     correlated with the better use of language.                                                                                                     I think you must be dreaming.

Howdy all,                                                                 I think this section is lacking in a topic of serious discussion. Howabout this one: Suicide.                                                   Note, I am NOT writing this as a person activly considering this     option. In fact, things are going quite well for me for a change. But,  the thought has passed through my mind, in a more than casual way, in   the past. As well, in the past year, two of my friends have taken this  way out. One quietly, hanging her self in a hotel room. The other, more dramatically, diving off the balcony at a crowded party. Last week, one of the people I work with was driving on on 86, and say a person jump infront of a dump truck. When the truck swerved to miss, the guy jumped infront again, ending his life.                                              With the state of the economy, and the job market, I suspect a lot ofpeople are thinking on these lines. Many people are feeling             down/depressed. (A relative of mine is in the hospital for depression.) Anyway, anybody have any things to add to this discusion.                                                                                       Mark                                                                    well I will !  Heard about the new car i might be getting !  A honda    Accord Hatchback !  Wow eh???                                           Ah, yes, but it is the subtle ones that you are not worrying about whiledrunk that are going to make you lose the head game in the long haul.   Whilst you ponder only the simplistic, the diplomats and politicians areusing their hidden agendas to play the ultimate head game upon you...   you actually think you understand them!  I hold David Duke to light for example.                                                                MOZ...                                                                  ya blew it.                                                             those hatchbacks are a good car! what year is it? ohhh, an 86, light    blue and was in an accident recently...i see...                         actually there is a lot more room in the back than it looks...when we   went away in the summer we managed to get a tent, a hugh box of food andpots and pans, two backpacks, two duffle bags, and various other        goodies, and that was only in the back, we didn't even have to put the  seats down!                                                             well i don't beleive in suicide, it's a cowards way out! i had a friend who killed himself, he downed an entire bottle of pills and then went   "swimming" in a pond...a jogger found him and his brother had to go     identify the body. it's a very selfish act, they are only thinking aboutthemselves, and not even taking into considertion the feelings of the   people they leave behind...or the lives they ruin!  i admit when i was  16 i SERIOUSLY considered it, as i am sure many others have at one pointor another, but i had a very good teacher who really cared about his    students and one day we were all having a discussion about suicide and  he said that it is a "cop out" and his reasonings really made sense, andi respected him so much that i couldn't let him down!                   he did didn't he?????                                                   I agree with you a strike this close to the playoffs could have some    very serious negative effects in the future of the leauge.  I hope a    strike can be avoided!                                                  Hey Sultan , You really SUCK!   (big-time)                              I'm trying to finnish a paper for a women's studies course about eating disorders.  I've been anorexic, and believe that anorexia is a physical statement about women's lack of power in society.  Anorexia nervosa is  like a hunger strike.  The suffragettes went on hunger strikes in       Brithish prisons,  Gandhi went on a hunger strike for Indian            emancipation....there is something about intentional starvation that is political...                                                            Anybody have ideas or experiences I could use in my paper ?             I blew it? In what way?                                                 Thats pretty much the way I see it too, as a cop out, and a very selfishact. But people do it. And I think that the number will increase, unlessthe state of the economy changes.                                        I know that this is a dificult thing for people to talk about, but I   have become somewhat interested in it latly, due to the reasons I       mentioned in my previous message. Plus, this base seemed to be lacking  in serious discusion, so I thought I would interject something. It      appears I may have hit a nerve!                                         Well for those of you who haven't as of yet called! There is a          relatively new board in this area called Sysop Elite BBS.               the number is 763-3354, But it is for Sysops, and co-sysops ONLY.       I would like to invite all sysops and there co's to join....                                            thanks                                                                          Frodo                           Forget it.... nada importa.                                             Suicide, touchy subject sure to rile the masses.                                                                                                Like many, I have considered suicide at some point in life.  Luckily, I didn't have the guts/stupidity to go through with it.                                                                                           For the most part, I feel that suicide is an absolute waste.  For even  the most desolate character, things do eventually turn around.  This canbe very hard to believe in during real low-points, though.  Sadly, many who have been successful in their effort to escape could possibly have  regained a will to live, if only they had given it one more try.                                                                                I do believe though, that there are a few out there who are not equippedemotionally to deal with life.  Day to day exsistance is hard enough on these souls, without the occasional traumas we all must endure.  For    those few who TRULY cannot endure, nor GENUINELY wish to, I think it    should be handled in a different manner.  The self-help for suicides, asit were.  Rather than "dial a prayer" help lines, there should be       suicide centres.  Wanna-beNOTS could then go in for help.  After being  counselled, examined and generally brain-scanned, should the person     still maintain that suicide would be the choice of preference, then theyshould be helped along in a humane manner that would ensure a quick,    painless death without possibility of surviving as a vegatable for the  rest of their days.                                                                                                                             As for the inevitable arguement that suicide is selfish, is it not even more selfish to will someone to live for others?  You have to want to   live for yourself to pull you out of a suicidal phase, not for those    around you.  Chances are quite likely that some of those people who     would later decry your selfishness are the self-same ones who made you  feel that distinct "aloneness" that makes suicide seem like the only wayout in the first place.  I feel it is even more selfish to have more    pity for those left behind, who will cope, than to show pity for those  who couldn't cope.  me, me, me.. i feel so sorry for me and the poor    slob who killed himself just copped out was selfish?  ok....            I'm not saying that polititions will win, I'm just saying that they onlymake sense drunk.  If you actually get into a mind game with them, or   anyone else, the only way to handle it is to try and keep them off      balance before they get you off.                                                                                                                                                                                        This is a standard programming assignment for anyone learning a languagefor the first time (ie: any language, ever).                                                                                                    I probably have a copy of life around somewhere -- but I'm sure you     could probably also write it yourself without too much trouble.  It's anincredibly simple program --                                                                                                                    Unless this "Conway" program is somehow significantly more complex than the ordinary Life programs they have people write in introductory       classes.                                                                                                                                                                                 Justin                                                                                                 I think anorexia nervosa quite often (these days: perhaps always) has   political implications -- but I think they are quite opposite the sort  of politics involved in a hunger strike.                                                                                                        There is no clear and simple explanation for a disorder like anorexia   nervosa.  It is always a complicated set of circumstances and individualpeculiarities, and I doubt that anyone can really explain it all to any great satisfaction.                                                                                                                             However, I do think it is safe to assume that one of the major factors  involved is a general lack of self-worth and self-confidence.  Perhaps  the victim was abused.  Perhaps they have simply been thwarted too many times, and can't achieve the things they would like.  These are no doubtvery political considerations --                                                                                                                One might say that, in the anorexic, the will has sunk to such a low    level that the person is virtually attempting suicide.                                                                                          On the other hand, a hunger strike is an exertion of the will rather    than the defeat.  The individual is attempting to force someone or      something into submission -- be it the British rulers in India, or the  attitudes of WWI era men.  Rather than a defeated will, a hunger strikeris an example of a will seeking victory, an attempting to grasp more    power.                                                                                                                                          And I think it is generally safe to say that a hunger strike is         indicitave of a surplus of self-confidence and an overflowing of        self-worth: a general statement of defiance, conducted out of the beliefthat the world will consider your life valuable, and wish to save it andkeep you from harm.                                                                                                                             I find it hard to picture Ghandi embarking on his hunger stike because  he felt utterly defeated and hopeless --                                                                                                                                                          Justin                Hmmm.. somehow I doubt that...                                          Well, that's exactly what I need, lots of Room !  You know me and my    extra ciricular activities. No WORK to RULE here lemme tell ya !  Well, i figure they have to be one of the most reliable cars around !         Well, why didn't you just say my team sucks rather than saying i suck ! I didn't say you suck ! tsk, tsk tsk Well, too bad those frogs are      having probs... and to ask a sincere question... would the Canadiens    even consider Grant Fuhr for a goalie. Most fans say NO, i say FOR SURE they would. Opinions                                                    Well, if you need abreather, you just make sure Katherine is over as    well.  That way I can get into my pitchin groove !  Well Have a good one!                                                                                               LEAFS RULE                                                                 Loverboy ?????????                           No problem...I will give Kathy a call...I think she's into menage a     trois...???                                                             Leafs Rule...HA...did you see the way they blew last night's            game...LOSERS!!                                                              Jays Rule!!!!                                                      Ok sultan you dont suck, the leafs do .  What the hell do you mean the  Frog are having probs...?                                               #1- the habs are doing excellent and have no probs                      #2- having a french backround i resent being labeled as a Frog.  Surely i could find some even more colorful insults to pester you with         Sultan... But alas My standards are far too high to allow me to insult  different races with blind predjudice.                                  Having lived in Montreal for a good 10 years i can asure you that there are no frogs there aside from the ones in creeks and small rivers.  And yes we do look like you Ontarians and we are the same in every          way-except we have better manners.  (we do not insult people of         different cultures blindly and for no reason)                           Finally in response to your question- Yes, i think Grant Fuhr would makean excellent back-up behind Patrick Roy.                                                                      S.L.                              Don't you love playing mind games best with people who have no ideas of the rules?                                                              This was the original program that was writen at mit back in the late   50's or early 60's but i imagine the the program that you have a very   simalar to the original that he wrote how could i get it off you?       I'm also looking for anything involing the mandelbrot set i'm not sure if its possible to get a program on the subjet but i'd love to know .    More spicifcally i'm needing to know if the mandelbrot set is recursive?its usally a recursively enumerable set which is not recusive! can      anybody help me?                                                        Also Anything on M.Minsky would be a great asset to me                  Re: people that like computer languages.                                Yes it does make sense.  I think that a feel for linguistics crosses allfields, from writting prose through poetry to computer languages.  One  of the things that I particularly like about computers is that you can  get to understand language as a pure entity.  That is, the mechanistic  parts of language are subject not only to study, but to testing.        Inventing a new language and subjecting it to the rigor of using it to  descripe real world functions is a rather enlightening experience.      Sorry about the rather fractured prose above, but writing without an    editor over a long distance phone line does not encourage editing.      I'll send you one of my manuals Justin.  I not only gaurantee that you  can understand it, but I'd expect you to enjoy it.                          The main reason for manuals being poorly written is that software   publishing firms have traditionaly considered them unimportant.  The areusually an afterthought, and have little time spent on them.            I've written a couple of versions of life, but it was a long time ago. Ithink I probably have at least one version still arround somewhere.  Ah.found it (running on second node).  It is in assembler.  Do you have    MASM?  Do you want source?                                              Sean, I have put life source and executable on my board in the MISC     files area.  The number is 656-2274.                                    I think, Sylvia, that you are mistaken when you assume that the search  for a lifestyle is a feminist issue.  All of us are faced with the same issue.  The union moement, for example, was essentially a fight by      people not wishing to be owned by industry.  The history of the world isreplete with groups struggling to get out from "ownership", whether it  be by the biggest bully arround, a political group, or a landed         aristocracy.                                                               On a more individual level, men do not get into positions of power   without fighting for them eithor.  While I am quite willing to admit    that the deck tends to be stacked against women, you might want to      consider that it is stacked against everyone.  There are 4 billion      people in the world.  There are only a few positions at the top.        Well said, Dennis.  I will be celibrating my 25th wedding anniversary   this summer, and the longer I live with Heather the more I come to      believe that men and women are not different. People are different ...  I am more likely to not understand another man with cultural            differences, for example, than a woman that has a similar background to myself.                                                                 The old chestnut about the oil producing countries rears its' head againeh?  They have been telling that story for dozens of years, and it is   simply not true.  The hydrogen car is not being driven right now simply because it is too expensive.  It requires all stainless steel           contruction (water rusts steel), and electrolysys to produce hydrogen   (probably from nuclear generated electricity), is about five times the  price of gasoline per mile.                                             Hi, Scanning the latest talks on suicide has got me wondering. It's     seens the disscussion should be teenage or juvenile suicide. To me,     suicide in the face of adversity is an unthought out action be this     group of people. Personally, I think they did not seriously consider allthe options. The pain of what ever they were going threw; strife        hopelessness etc; they had no clues to handle this difficulty. They may have been to afraid to admit to friends, after all you usually don't letyour friends get to good an idea of how insecure your life is. They     could not relly on there families either. Disfuntional? Any way, it     seems to me the alterative to die is something far more comfortable thenaltering the troubles. They failed to consider an approach that would   remove them from the familar hurts, but lead them to unfamilar ends in asolution that didn't include death.                                      However, a conscience choice to end your life, in and of itself cannot be ruled out. As generalizations are not always (hardly ever) applicableto individual cases.

EAch cell has eight neighbors, and we will    denote by OCC(K) the number of cells adjacent to cell K which are       occupied by an organism.  The configuration of a new generation of      organisms is obtained from the previous generation by applying two      simple rules:                                                                                                                                   (1) An organism in cell K survives to the next generation if                2 <= OCC(k) <= 3, otherwise it dies.

Note taht all changes occur simultaneously,  and so the program must maintain two copies of the configuration.  Test your proram with a seven cell U-shaped pattern, the first six           generations of which are shown below:                                                                                                           ...

It is a simple exercise to construct such a program.  If you aren't a   programmer, however, I could probably throw it together in no time at   all.  I'm not sure if I actually have a coded copy.  It might be an     interesting thing for me to do because I've wanted to play around with  my code optimizing utilities for awhile, and this is the sort of        'textbook' problem that would good to practice optimizing on.

The main  engine is a loop of instructions that takes its starting complex number and applies the arithmetical rule to it.  For the Mandelbrot set, the   rule is this:                                                                                                                                   z -> z-squared + c                                                                                                                              where z begins at zero, and c is the complex number corresponding to thepoint being tested.  So, take 0, multiply it by itself, and add the     starting number; take the result -- the starting number -- multiply it  by itself, and add the starting number; take the new result, multiply itby itself, and add the starting number.  Arithmetic for complex numbers is straightforward.  A complex number is written with two parts: for    example, 2 + 3i (the address for the point at 2 east and 3 north on the complex plane).  To add a pair of complex numbers, you just add the realparts to get a new real part and the imaginary parts to get a new       imaginary part:                                                                                                                                   2 + 4i                                                                + 9 - 2i                                                                ----------                                                               11 + 2i                                                                                                                                        To multiply two complex numbers, you multiply each part of one number byeach part of the other and add the four results together.  Because i    multiplied by itself equals -1, by the original definition of imaginary numbers [i is the square root of -1], one term of the result collapses  into another.                                                                                                                                   So (2 + 3i) * (2 + 3i)                                                   = 4 + 12i + 9i-squared                                                  = 4 + 12i - 9                                                           = -5 + 12i                                                                                                                                     To break out of this loop, the program needs to watch the running total. If the total heads off to infinity, moving farther and farther from thecenter of the plane, the original point does not belong to the set, and if the running total becomes greater than 2 or smaller than -2 in eitherits real or imaginary part, it is surely heading off to infinity -- the program can move on.  But if the program repeats the calculation many   times WITHOUT becoming greater than 2, then the point is part of the    set.  How many times depends on the amount of magnification.  For the   scales accessible to a personal computer, 100 or 200 is often plenty,   and 1000 is safe.                                                                                                                               The program must repeat this process for each of thousands of points on a grid, with a scale that can be adjusted for greater magnification.    And the program must display its result.  Points in the set can be      colored black, other points white.  Or for a more vividly appealing     picture, the white points can be replaced by colored gradations.  If theiteration breaks off after ten repetitions, for example, a program mightplot a red dot; for twenty repetitions an orange dot; for forty         repetitions a yellow dot; and so on.  The choice of colors and cutoff   points can be adjusted to suit the programmers taste.  The colors revealthe contours of the terrain just outside the proper set."

I always say that before I say what I am going to say next, because it upsets people too much and then rather than answer my points they cop-out by suggesting that anyone who says such things must be suicidal (I'm not) --                                                                                                                                                                          I think people have a right to suicide.  I think if someone wants to    kill themselves, more power to them.  In fact, once we have determined  that this is what they really want, we should help them to do so.                                                                               Rather than having to kill themselves in some hidden alcove somewhere,  leaving a body to find, there should be clean, painless facilities      available for those who wish to use them.                                                                                                     (1) Supporting someone (emotionally and physically) who is suicidal         is costly and inefficient.  They are generally a weakness in            society and they know it.  Therefore if they want to die, by            all means assist them.                                                                                                                      (2) Suicide, for someone whose life has been a complete wreck,              mess, and failure, is the only honourable way to regain a               sense of power: one should not forbid them their last, and              possibly only noble act.                                                                                                                    (3) Some people who lead productive, happy lives eventually come            to realize that it's all going to go downhill from the point            they are currently at.  So badly downhill that they are going           to lose all of their dignity and self respect.  This may be             the result of a disease or illness, or age and a broken                 spirit.  In either case they should not be prevented from               choosing the time of their own death, and die at the right              time.                                                                                                                                       (4) From a more individual perspective -- you will probably                 admit to me that you are not willing to tell someone else               how to live their life.  Given that you haven't even allowed            yourself the right to do that, how can you further command              them to live, when they would rather die?                                                                                                   I realize that this is all probably completely alien to you.  These are not "polite" things to say in our society, and previously you probably  thought some of this to be "unthinkable".  Yet -- it is quite thinkable,and I urge you to think about it.

I should explain that I don't "ascribe" to "feminism".  I squeamishly   write "feminism" like I write "patriarchy".  It boggles my mind that menand women could exist for millenia within the same culture and remain   in different and usually unconstructively opposing categories.  I'd     rather be a person than a feminist, but hardly ever get a chance.       I thought you wanted to be amoral ?  I you are amoral, then upon which  criteria are you able to judge somebody else's life to be "a complete   wreck" or a "failure" ?

I am fully capable of judging things, and deciding whether they are     successes or failures, or wrecks or worthwhile.                                                                                                 I just don't do it on the basis of whether or not it is evil or good.                                                                           People continually, and wrongfully, equate morality with value.  But    the two things are not nearly equivalent.                                                                                                       In fact I think morality is almost always OPPOSED to value.                                                                                     All life can be viewed in terms of a spirit of overcoming, or as        Nietzsche put it, a "will to power" -- things which further the spirit  of overcoming are valuable.  Things which oppose it are valueless.      Morality opposes it, therefore morality is valueless.                                                                                           Back on topic: some people know that they are ebbing -- that they are ontheir way to their downfall.  And to put it quite bluntly: when         something cannot be taught to fly, it should be taught to fall faster.                                                                                                                        Justin                                                                                            ps: note -- if all things are the spirit of overcoming, then something      actually CANNOT oppose the spirit of overcoming, since it is itself     an extension of the spirit of overcoming -- the distinction is          actually between a growing spirit and a declining spirit: between       strength and decadence (as in: decaying).                                                                                                                                                                           I will answer your questions as best I can, and then post a more        comprehensive response with new points --                                                                                                       Re: It is selfish, what about the loved ones you leave behind                                                                                   Selfish acts are the best kinds of acts.  In my view, you are actually  stating a further reason why it is a good thing for such persons to killthemselves.  If someone acts in an anti-selfish way, then they are      acting in opposition to all that is natural.  They are defying life,    negating life.  In short, weakening themselves, making themselves petty,and bringing down everyone around them as well.  Better for such personsto remain selfish and die with dignity.                                                                                                         Better for them to die a natural death -- paradoxically, if selfishness leads them to suicide, then suicide is a way of affirming the value of  life.                                                                                                                                           Re: the loved ones they leave behind                                                                                                            Are not quite so loving as you suggest.  Let's face it - if we turned   around and said suicide is OK, then the suicidal person wouldn't have toleave little secret notes behind.  S/he could approach these loved ones and say goodbye in person.  They would no doubt try and talk him/her outof suicide, and perhaps succeed.  BUT -- if they don't succeed, and the suicide goes ahead as planned, it WON'T be a nasty surprise waiting for them in the morning.  It WON'T be a shock, and a sudden loss.  It will  be a noble parting, with dignity and good memories.  People will have   their chance to say farewell.                                                                                                                   A much better scenario.  A noble scenario.  And really: a beautiful, andlife affirming scenario.                                                                                                                        And again paradoxically -- I think this sort of HEALTHY attitude about  death would result in fewer suicides, although that is not necessarily agood thing.                                                                                                                                     Re: what happens if everyone acted on their feelings                                                                                            Agreed.  Not everyone is capable of acting on their feelings and        surviving.  However, if everyone acted on their feelings then soon      enough we would have a stronger society.  Quite simply: natural         selection would guarantee it.                                                                                                                   The weak, however, will NEVER act on their feelings.  Their feelings    frighten them too much.  They run about looking for ways to avoid their feelings, searching out this morality and that.  They ensure that their basic feelings remain oppressed and unexpressed.  This is a condition   which will continue, no matter what.  The weak will always be terrified of themselves, and as a result, bind themselves with moral imperatives.                                                                         SO -- to allow people to act on their feelings would really only make a difference for the strong, who are CAPABLE of it.  The vast majority,   the weak, would never dare to attempt it.                                                                                                                                                     Justin                                                                                            As I sort of hinted in my last message, I think there is a big problem  in this society which revolves around an unhealthy attitude toward      death.                                                                                                                                          People think death is something to be avoided at all costs.  Something  horrible and evil.  Something terrible.                                                                                                         There is nothing terrible, or horrible, or evil about death.  There is  something terrible, and horrible, (and I would almost say evil), about  abhorring death.  And something despicable as well.                                                                                             Death is not something to be avoided.  It is not an absolute negative.  Sometimes people CHOOSE to die for very positive, life affirming        reasons.                                                                                                                                        Is it an absolute negative to die so that your children can live?                                                                               I think almost everyone will agree that it is not.  And I suggest that  there are all kinds of further reasons why someone might want to choose to die, and be affirming life in choosing so.                                                                                                   To give up your life so that your children can survive you, and         hopefully even prosper, has to be one of the most LIFE AFFIRMING things that any human being could possibly do.                                                                                                         Another thing which affirms life is the decision to die because you knowthat all your greatest achievements are behind you, and that continuing to live would REDUCE you.  To die at the right time...                                                                                          And in the case in point, only one more step from this, is the choose todie because you realize you are decadent.  Because you realize that you are weak, and impotent, and powerless and will never be other.  In such cases a decision to die is a NOBLE decision -- it raises you above the  contempibile life you lead and allows you to die with dignity: to affirmstrength, passion, and growth by ridding the world of an element of     weakness, mediocrity, and decadence -- an affirmation of life.                                                                                  This whole discussion really revolves around the fear of death prevalentin our society -- the IRRATIONAL fear, the ANTINATURAL fear, the absurd and ridiculous assumption that death is some kind of loss.                                                                                      So let me pose this question -- WHY do you consider death a "bad" or    "evil" result?                                                                                                                                                                                    Justin                Have you been locked up in your room and constantly calling BBSes since the ice age?  Look out the window for once.  See the bright object in   the sky (yes it's still blue), that's the sun.  Now, about Dave Stieb,  don't you know that they guy is recovering from back surgery and hasn't pitched for 5 months?  He can't even get it over the plate yet.  Give   him time and he'll be back around May.  Why don't you turn off that     computer right now and unlock your door, get some chlorophyll from      sunlight for once, maybe it will enhance your knowledge of baseball.                 yours truly......:-)                                       I'll upload the DMA info in just a day or so.  It'll be in the          programming area and have "DMA" somewhere in the title.  I just have to collect the various messages into a neat bundle.                                                                                                                                        Andy Stedman                    Well It's taken me awhile but I can reply now.  The problem was that I  had some HD problems at the beginning of the year and just now got everyback to normal I have been bbsing but did not come across the Boss      number until lately.  The new Bbs for the moment is not going to be up  as I may be starting a buisness and need the line for that.  Oh well I  will chat later                                                         Congratulations on the 25th annivesary Donald. Whether you and Heather  spend it alone together or among friends I wish you all the best for theday, and for the future.                                                                                                                          Roberta and I will celibrating our 10th in July.  We remember well    those who told us that it wouldn't last 10 months. I love proving peoplewrong sometimes.                                                                                                                                  As far as finding fellow males more difficult to understand, I must   agree; and I don't even have to go to another culture to find them.  As long as I can remember my best friends for the most part have been      women.  Most of the fellows I know find me a little on the odd side.    The vast majority of them cannot get past the fact that I don't like    watching hockey.  THAT'S RIGHT ALL YOU JOCKS WHO ARE UNDOUBTEDLY READINGTHIS AND SCRATCHING YOUR HEADS - I DON'T WATCH HOCKEY!!! OR FOOTBALL FORTHAT MATTER.  In fact the only sport I find interests me is baseball. I find I like the idea that it's the only sport i know of where the       defence has control of the ball.  If anyone knowws of another please    drop me a line.                                                                                                                                   Getting back on topic;  as I said most of the men I've met can't get  past that. Whereas the wommen I've known couldn't care less if my       interests differ from thiers, they're quite content to discuss what eversubjects we do have in common or else listen to me discuss a subject    they know little about for the sake of conversation. I find listening tothem quite interesting as well. I really wish that I could get into     discussions with some of the guys in this same manner, but as soon any  subject other than sports or politics comes up it's end of discussion.                                                                          Till next time......Dennis                                                                                                                      re: DMA info                                                                                                                                      Thanx a lot!                                                          re:death being 'bad'                                                    Well, I think being dead is an experience I don't really look forward   too...Just not on my schedule for a long time at least. :-)             btw, Freud believed that each of us has a subconscious part that drives us towards the 'darker things' in life, like death, and there is a      counterpart, usually more evident, that is a life-loving force.  Don't  know if contemporary psychology still thinks this idea holds water, but it's interesting.                                                       Dying for a cause means you have to put things ahead of yourself, which many people will not do.  There are very few things I would die for, butI suppose they exist.  I don't think most people or any at all would    ever be in a situation like this, so I don't consider it important to   think about.  dying for your country is pretty silly in most cases.     Sometimes the cause is good, but most of the time it's just silliness.  I don't care what people think of me when I'm gone, I just hope I gave  people happiness when I was alive.                                      Geez, that was pretty deep.                                                Steve                                                                re:suicide                                                              well, some victims do intend to go all the way up until they begin the  act.  There was a guy talking about suicide on TV a while ago who jumpedfrom a bridge, and changed his mind on the way down.  Luckily, he lived.People don't really think about it until they are confronted with dying in the very near future, and many turn back, if they can.  Of course    there are others who still believe they are doing the best thing.       sort of off topic and in the gruesome humour dept, there was a rather   unlucky guy who jumped from an overpass bridge, and on the way down he  was hit by a bus.  And after all that he lived anyways.  He's apparentlytried many times and somehow it always goes wrong.                      Geez, people are leaving really depressing messages lately...must be    near exams or something :-)                                             re:suicide                                                              I agree with you about suicide not really being an answer.  I've felt   really rotten now and then, and the only thing that cheers me up is the fact that I'm still living.  At least I'm still able to feel the pain.  better than feeling nothing at all.                                     So!  This area has become really depressing, have you noticed?  It's    good for people who are upset to talk about it, but lets have some fun. Like, for instance, ummmm, let's see.  I had a strange thing happen to  me a while ago.  I was visiting a married couple a while ago, and they  started having fun right in front of me!  Really odd.  Has anyone else  had an experience like this?  I wonder if they wanted me to join them?  It is definitely something I won't forget for a long while! :-)             Steve                                                                                                                                       Re: Death.. you are not planning on it.                                                                                                         I am not planning on it either.  But neither am I wasting my time       worrying about it, and trying to avoid it.  I hope to die well, and at  the right time.  Death is not an enemy.                                                                                                         And anyways -- without death, without destruction: well, you could      hardly have anything new if you never got rid of the old.                                                                                       There could be no life without death.  And I think too highly of life totrade it for a lack of death.                                                                                                                   Re: Freud -- he had ideas about human nature involving two forces,          a force which draws toward darkness and death, and a force              which draws toward light and life.                                                                                                          No, Freuds theories no longer hold water with contemporary psychology.  But they are interesting nonetheless -- even if only as interesting     examples of classic errors.                                                                                                                     I do not like this silly notion that life and death are in some kind of opposition.  It seems to me that they are really the same thing, and    that one causes the other: and that neither could exist without the     other.  In fact -- that everything good and great about the one, is an  outgrowth of the other.                                                                                                                         I think all thinks light and beautiful, warm and happy, good and pure: Ithink they grow out of all things dark and ugly, cold and spiteful, eviland contemptible.                                                                                                                               And as for explanations of life: In philosophical jargon I would be     called a "monist".  In normal language that means I view everything as  stemming from a unified cause.  Not a duality.  Not a "good vs evil" or a "mind vs body" or a "divine vs mortal".                                                                                                       I think that everything in life can be reduced to two things: a desire  to grow, to overcome, to expand, to conquer on the one hand... and fear on the other -- fear of being overcome, of death, of shrinking, and     being conquered.                                                                                                                                And if you look at it this way, you soon see that these two things are  really the same thing.  There is no qualitative difference between them,rather it is a matter of degree -- how strong are you?  When you are    strong, you are victorious, overcoming, growing.. when you are weak you are shrinking, defeated, overcome... these things, formerly thought to  be opposites, are one and the same thing.                                                                                                       All life can be viewed as stemming from a "spirit of overcoming", to putit one way, or a "will to power" to put it another.                                                                                             And this is why people are willing to die for things.  Most of the time their spirit of overcoming needs them to live, in order to overcome: butin some cases things can be best overcome if one dies for them --                                                                               I think this is the essential thing that Freud, and also Darwin missed. Life is not a striving for life -- life is a striving for power, and a  desire to overcome.. to overcome EVERYTHING.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Justin                                                                                        You comment that this area has become depressing --                                                                                             Well?  Why has it become depressing?  Because someone mentioned death?  Suicide?  What is so depressing about that?                                                                                                     I think this is merely your prejudice, that you think these things are  necessarily depressing.  I don't think they are depressing.  In fact    sometimes thinking about death, and all the things it means, fills me   with great joy and happiness.                                                                                                                   When I see something come to an end, I can only wonder what will take   its place, and how without death, nothing ever could.                                                                                                                                             Justin                Welll.... I have walked in on people by accident, but that is the       closest i can come to yours.  I did, however, recently have someone     stand up and show me his boxer shorts... does that count?  (cool!  glow in the dark undies!)                                                    Kelly has a thing for lanything after what she's been driving.  Hey, thePaddy Wagon is even appealing to her, pulling upto the Red light area   and piling them in ! ahahaha                                            BACKUP !!!!!! HA !  He's a hell of a lot better than ROY and "red-light"Racciot !   Boy, I would admit Courtnall would be a fine 2nd centre in  TO, but alas Montreal fans will never admit that Fuhr is superior to Roy!  Well to each his own and I will predict that those guys aren't gonna make it outta the Adams !  Actually I even like BOSTON !  A team with a handful of good players, but lot's of HEART !  GO BRUINS GO !!!!!!!!    Well, to answer that:  Stieb has thrown 2 simulated games, one was SH*T and the other was finely tuned.  Actually it's been 10 months, but he'llwin it all for them !  Jack Morris shouldn't be starting, Stottlemyre   should !  Morris, i never liked him, and never will !                   Well, Darwin wasn't really concerned with the consciousness aspect of   life, just how we came to be in our physical condition.                 You can also view like and death as changes in entropy, if you like.    People cannot decrease entropy in the universe.   It's sort of a limit, you can approach a perfect system where entropy is not increase, but    you;ll never get there.  You can also just view people as a massive     chemical reaction going on - it all depends on whether you believ there is more to that in consciousness.  I really havn't decided.  I believe  in evolution, but I don't discount the unexplained, only the rediculous.You are assuming that things must die in order for like in whole to     advance - this is only partially true - only in an evolutionary way.  Ifpeople were immortal, barring accidents, there would be no limit to whatthey could do.  For example, a chemist could experiment for as long as  he/she wanted to.  Are you saying that they would get no more out of    that then their normal life span?   Many people have died in the midst  of important work -take Fermat's last theorem.  Many mathematicians     would give anything to talk to him to find out what the hell he meant   and how he proved it.  Anyways, I think death is depressing because     living life is what gives me happiness, and experiencing new things is  what life is all about.  Being dead, you tend not to expenience much    new, I think.  Unless you believe in a heaven type thing, again I'm     undecided.  Being a science student, a need proof to believe, and yet   fact is exactly what religeon is not, for a large part.  But religeon isa large part of what we grow up in (many of us, anyways), and it has    it's effects.  Sort of like how women are in many cases brought up to besubserviant to men, and so many are.  I don't think there's much more   than that to the differences between the sexes.                         Back to death.  I agree that a world of immortals would be difficult to manage unless hte birth rate was strictly controlled, which is          difficult, and some would argue that it would be against their rights.  So, it is impractical to have everyone immortal.  I sometimes wonder if someone somewhere has found a way to extend people's lives, but is not  allowed or doesn't want to release the information because of the great impact that would have on population dynamics.  Probably not, though.   Life and death is a natural cycle, but that doesn't mean it has to be   followed.  Perhaps sometime we will evolve from the necessity of death  (if it is necessary now, that is?)  I don't think we're qualified to    judge people on whether they should live or die or not.  I think it     should be up to themselves, as long as they don't harm others in the    process.                                                                You meant the kind with glow-in-the-dark hearts?  I have a pair too! :-)Hmmmm...So, you tied up some poor guy and stripped his clothes off?     Nasty girl!  (just kidding!)  I'm in an obnoxious mood right now (ok,   horny could describe it as well ;-)                                     It was quite the experience to have a couple do that in front of me.  I eventually left them to themselves, but it was fun watching for a bit.  I guess they liked the fact that they were being watched.  interesting. I don't think I've ever walked in on anyone by accident.                One person I know said they walked into a room at a party, and found twogirls having fun with each other with beer bottles!  Wierd people!      So I developed the film, and made a wall poster, and...kidding! just    kidding!  hehehe                                                        geez, I'm in a strange mood today.  So, you made your boyfriend take hispants off and display his radioactive shorts?  hmmmm...did anything elseglow in the dark? ;-)                                                   Ok, Ok, hormone overdose...anyways, let's see...Vell, I remember once   when I was staying overnight at camp (in grade 5) when a girl invited meinto her tent.  we talked all night and when we got up, she told me not to look and took her clothes off and changed.  So what did I do?  I     didn't look.   duuuuuuh!  hehehe.  I think she was teasing me and wantedme to peek, but I'm not sure.  I've always been too shy, anyway.        I think I must have some sort of brain damage (no comments from the     peanut gallery please!)...every time a girl shows some sort of interest,I do something really stupid.  Like last year after writing an exam a   girl kept following me around and walking really close to me (she waitedfor me to come out of the exam room), so I just talked with her for a   while and then left, never seeing her again.  After a while (it takes a while for things like this to sink through the first few feet of my     skull) I realized that she may have been interested.  Could have been myimagination, but it fits pretty well with the patten, don't you think.  Actually, there's a guy I know who usually competes with my brain damagepretty well - we have a sort of competition going about who can screw upmore with women.  I think I'm winning, but not by much.  He goes to     strip joints sometimes, and has apparently had a couple dancers hit on  him (asking him is he's attached now, and saying 'good!' when he says   no, and talking for a long time. Hmmmmmm....I don't think that would be the place I would look for a girlfriend.  I like the innocent yet       mischevious type.  sigh!                                                This is getting to be a really long note!  So, what other interesting   experiences have you had?  (am I getting personal or what? :-)          Speaking of course as a mother .... the most embarrasing situations are when you have a "little" audience...                                    It sure takes a lot of explaining  especially when they are really      young..                                                                 My wierdest experience was once I had phoned this person I knew and she answered the phone...but after  few minutes she started making these    strange noises..if you know what I mean...I asked her if she was busy   (I know dumb question)...anyway she said yes..but the strangest part wasthat she wanted me to keep talking to her...because it turned her       on...wow...needless to say I don't hang around this person anymore she  was just too strange for my blood...                                    Hockey?  Isn't that the one where they beat each other with sticks whileattempting to slide a rubber thingy over a piece of ice?                More seriously, I agree with you partially, but expect that a lot of it is just the people that you associate with.  A lot of our friends are   academics, so it tends to be a bit more mixed crowd.  And since Heather and I own our company and work to-gether, we do not have a "work" crowd to hang out with.  Topics use to be mainly kids and raising them, but   that changes as they get older.

But, for example, what is the advantage for you to report a    crime that has no bearing on you? Or how about picking up a piece of    litter that someone else dropped? There's no advantage to you but it    helps everyone by keeping the enviroment clean. There are lots of thingsthat we do that have no tangible benefits for us but which help others. How about helping a blind person? or giving someone directions? or      giving to charity? These are all good acts. Do you perform anything likethese tasks?

How come you hate the Jays so much and still know something about them? What team do you like so that I can make fun of them. :-)               By the way, the Leafs are going to make the playoffs.                   I agree with you there man.  How can Fuhr be a backup to Roy?  That's   ridiculous.  How many Stanley Cups has Roy won in his career?  Look at  how may rings Fuhr has.  I admit the Habs are good but they could alwaysuse Fuhr as their #1 goalie.                                            Why Stottlemyre?  Why not Jimmy Key?  He's their most consistent        pitcher.  About Stottlemyre, he's too unpredictable.  Some days he's    great and other days he really stinks.

I'm a doer, not a      bragger.                                                                yeah well there's no accounting for SOME people's taste...now take us   HONDA driver's we are a whole other class..."i'm too sexy for my car"   you have been awfully quite these days...wassamatta?                    i don't fear death...when my time comes then i will be ready to go.     but i WOULD not take my own life, nor would i encourage anyone else to! i don't think death is "evil" by any means, but i don't agree with      taking your own life! i beleive we were put on this earth for a reason, not to just trudge around feeling sorry for ourselves and when things toget too rough and when we cannot cope anymore end our lives! i think of all the wasted lives, the young kids, who knows what the could have     contributed to society.                                                 do you beleive in an after life? or do you think once you are dead,     that's it.                                                              i'll write more later when i am more awake!                             what exactally do you mean by "having fun"? kissing, touching or the twoof them rolling around groping each others genatils?                    it happens all the time at the jungle!! ONLY KIDDING!                   come on now, he didn't stand up and show you...he had his bathrobe on   and as you were leaving he stuck his leg out to show you! he also       mentioned SOMEONE showing off their bra! (wasn't me either, was it      GUYS?)                                                                  well i think your friend should stay away from the strip joints         especially to meet women! and do you really think they were interested  in a relationship? i think not! $50 and i will be your friend for an    hour!                                                                   Yes, I failed to consider the attention getter suicide. It is sad that  the lack of communication in some relationships is so poor that someone would risk their life. The fact that your friend would try this at her  age. Perhaps she felt she wasn't allowed to grow emotional as she was   growing up. She may have got involved with him for the wrong reasons. I can only speculate.                                                     Hi, in regards to the view of life as the spirit of overcoming;         fascinating, similar to my own view. One thing though, split again and  see that life is to grandeous to be view from one perspective. I agree  with you, but I would keep an open mind.                                Ooooo!  Hmmmm, that sounds very interesting!  So, just vhat do ve do,   eh?  Hmmm...Ve'll have to keep an eye on dis vone, Dr! :-)              So what you like is nice tight bikini swimsuits that really define      everything underneath?  Hmmmm...I have to admit I do like that in girl'sbeach attire!  Whew!  I used to wear the traditional blue boxer shorts  to the beach, but last year I decided to get with it and bought a pain  of bikini shorts.  Geez they're revealing, aren't they?  I was in       Jamaica last Sept, hoping to catch some people topless (my hormones are really terrible!), but I didn't see many.  Darn!  Say, you were'nt there, were you? Hmmmm...So, what do you look like?  I'll have to go through my pics.  This may call for a poster blow-up! ;-)                            Steve                                                              Hehehehe - well, I guess they started out kissing, and then groping, andfinally they started having oral sex.  Very strange to be there as it's going on.  At that point I got a bit embarassed and left (well, went    upstairs - I could still hear when went on after that!) ;-)  Sort of a  thrill if you're not to shy (like I am!) and you know they want to be   seen or heard.                                                               2                                                                  Yes, I'm the imfamous #2!  Yep!  That's me!  (stupid macros!)                Steve                                                              (that's better!)                                                        Yep, that's probably the case.  I went a couple times with him a few    years ago, but I havn't really been interested lately.  I'd rather be   seeing someone who actually cared about whether I was having fun, and   maybe liked the fact that they were really turning me on.  It may sound strange, but I actually liked watching dancers more when they still had some clothes on.  Not sure why.  Maybe because a bit was left to the    imagination.  (Or something else's imagination! hehehe)                      Steve                                                              Re: awfully quiet                                                                                                                               I got to much darn homework, it's literally coming out my (*&^ !  Well, I'm going for the honda *just* as soon as i sell old money milker !     Well, I don't hate the Jays, they just make some really boneheaded moves!  I like them and the Yanks !  Leafs ???  Even though I would die for  the Leafs, Minnie won 5-3 or so last night !  Maybe next year in all    reality !                                                               Well, Montreal fans have ego problems !  They need to go through a last place dilemma to truly enjoy victory !  Fuhr.....HE RULES !!!!!         Well, Key's pithching the Home opener, so I'd go with Todd !  He's      probably been the best in spring traing !                               Hey, through the tuff times we Leaf fans were alwwed to route for any   team we wanted to Montreal !  And well, as the saying goes....          Real men where BLACK !                                                  No probs, call Kathy and hey.... How's about your EX, he'd like to have some fun to !  Oh Sorry, that would make you "some kinda MOM"           Well, Jays are almost ready for the break off the season !  WOW, Bell inChicago eh ???? I hate to admit, but I liked George Bell !  He may have been as ASS, but a damn good ball player !                              Ex's are definitely not included....they are   HISTORY....              5 more days till we get to see the Jays...                              Bell...yes you are  right he was a good ball player ..but no bedside    manner to speak of ..oh well can't have everything....                  Hockey Strike ...OH NO ...What are we going to do????                   Heck parents are people too...but you know what is really funny is that when you get older and start imagining your own parents doing "The Wild Thing"...and you wonder...gee  how did they do it????                   Speaking of bonehead moves, why in the world did the Yanks get Tartabullfor when they have overstocked outfield players?  What a waste of appr. 5 million bucks!!!!!! What they really need is pitching!  About the     Leafs, I think their chances of making the playoffs is slimmer than     skimmed milk.  They have to win all 3 and hope Minnie lose all of them. I hope we won't have a strike though because the playoffs is always moreexciting than anything else besides baseball playoffs.                  Of course Fuhr rules...Just look at how many saves he has to make every night the Leafs play.  All Roy does is just stand there and complain    whenever he gets scored on                                              What do you think of Guzman?  I think he has really stank so far this   spring training?                                                        About hiding extra songs or info on CD's...it is possible in fact it is done.  I have heard that on some Madonna (barf!) CD; may be a limited   edition or something, who cares!; anyways crap music aside, on one of   them there is some data somewhere on it where a normal CD player would  just skip, but pop it into a CD-ROM drive and voila!  Music video on    your PC!  This is what I was told by a guy at a computer store, too bad some quality artists haven't done the same.                                     Neat concept though...                                          Mark                                                                    Well 5 more days and the Jays (less the great Stieb) will hit the field !  Actually, I'm kinda excited.......can I come over to your pad to     watch the game or is the guy from the answering machine gonna be there  in my favourite seat !  If he's ther, i'll sit in your lap !  Actually, i'll sit in your lap, cause the NHL STRIKE !!! WAAAAHHHHHHH !!!         I would have to admit Roy is good, but NOT as good as FUHR !!!  Fuhr, insudden death, the oppsition is pressing will bail you out !  PLUS, Fuhr ain't scared of Al MaCinnis's shot !  ahahah                            I've often pondered the same question.  Hmmmm...I remember one person   saying 'the more you lose it in the hips, the better you get in the     lips'.   Gee, I wonder what he meant by that.  I'm too innocent to      figure it out I guess. ;-)                                              A couple I live with said they have done 'it' in a park before.  That's a bit too scary for me, I think.  I mean, what would you say if you werecaught?  "Hey!  This isn't my bedroom!"  or the old stayfast "Oops!"    Maybe if I lived somewhere a bit private.  Actually it's an interesting thought.  Maybe a bit too interesting for my hormones! *8-()            A question to the general public - has anyone done anything that riske? I never have outside, although I've tried to get away with it while my  parents were home when I lived there.                                                                                                           what do you do when Brian Mulroney throws a pin at you ?                i                                                                       You Better run because he has the hand grenade in his mouth!            What's all this about showing a bra off?  Did I miss it? Did I? Huh?    Awwwwwwww, geez!  Oh well.  Hmmmmm....do you have pictures?  OK, OK, I'mfine, now.  Most of the women I've known are really super-shy.  It's    really nice to see someone who is willing to be mischevious now and then;-)  I think it's really cute and very attractive for a woman to be     outgoing.  So, we were teasing some poor guy, were we?  :-)  It's funny what can turn a guy on, sometimes, like a girl sensuously brushing her  hair, putting lipstick on, (getting dressed and undressed just goes     without saying, doesn't it?  *8-)  I have no idea what women like.  Mostof the 'womens' calendars have things like 'Here's Bob doing an oil     change on his car'.  Is that something girls like?  Well, what do YOU   like a guy to do?  (just call me Mr. Personal!) ;-)                     ps -I think I'm addicted to making those smily faces :-)                :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) *8-} :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)does it hurt? i mean having  homework coming out your *&($@? it must!   maybe those are the chunks you found in the bathroom?                   glad to hear you have come to your senses and are gonna buy a HONDA!    say...you gonna back into me now? or do i have to?                      i wouldn't exactally consider her my friend, but she did it only to get the attention of her husband! it's a shame she had to resort to that, mei just sit mine down and say "your gonna listen...or else!" (just       kidding)                                                                well i would have left long before they started groping at each other!  there is a time and place, and i don't want to be the audience. that    reminds me of the high school days...when the parties turned into make  out sessions, pass! you want me to  come visit, then fine, but if you   want to start tongue wrestling, then i am going home...                 you should call up the sanitarium...there are all sorts of interesting  discussions about sex (where you have, where you would like to etc)     it's very eye opening!

Re: Someone who is amoral cannot distinguish between right and              wrong.  You think that only someone who is mentally handicapped         is unable to distinguish right from wrong.                                                                                                  It is not true that only mentally handicapped people are unable to      distinshish right from wrong.  In fact, I suggest that when it really   comes down to it, MOST if not ALL people are unable to distinguish      between right from wrong.                                                                                                                       Here's the catch:                                                                                                                               What most people are able to do is distinguish DOING GOOD from          DOING EVIL.  They are NOT able to distinguish between good and evil.                                                                            Here's proof: Tell me, what is the difference between good and evil?    The fact is that you, and everyone else, cannot answer this question to anyones satisfaction.  The best you can do is "I just know it is", whichreally means you don't know at all.                                                                                                             Here's the fundamentals of the catch:                                                                                                           What most people are able to do, is to distinguish whether they are     DOING AS THEY ARE TOLD from DOING AS THEY ARE TOLD NOT TO.                                                                                      What I am saying is this: I do not wish to "do as I am told".  I wish todo as I wish, and not as I am told.                                                                                                             And I suggest to you that it is this which those of limited mental      capabilities have the most trouble with -- acting on their own will,    rather than on the will which is imposed on them.                                                                                               It is much harder to command than to obey -- specifically, it is harder to command even yourself, than to obey someone (or something) else.                                                                             And when it comes right down to it: he who does not command, obeys.                                                                                                                                  Justin                                                                                     Re: Darwin                                                                                                                                      He wasn't concerned with consciousness, no.  He was concerned with how  things came to be as they are.  And he viewed everything as a struggle  for survival.  His theory has been changed since then, but the          philosophy remains intact, outside of the theory.                                                                                               (Evolution no longer views life as a struggle for survival, but more    objectively, merely as a process of selection -- yet the philosophy is  still prevalent, the idea still abounds that life is a struggle for     survival, and that the strongest and the fittest survive).                                                                                      The problem with this viewpoint is that life is NOT a struggle for      survival.  Therefore you cannot conclude that the strongest survive.    The strongest may prefer to die.                                                                                                                What life is actually, is a struggle for power.  And sometimes the most power is achieved through dying.  If you define "strongest" as "that    which has the most power" then in some cases those which die are        stronger than those which live.                                                                                                                 Take, for instance, the grasshopper.  The male grasshopper is killed by the female when they mate.  The strongest grasshoppers are those which  mate -- and die.  Therefore male grasshoppers which survive are weaker  than male grasshoppers which do not survive.                                                                                                    Of course the manner of the death is telling.  A grasshopper that gets  stepped on is not therefore strong.  It is the grasshoppers which       "choose" to die FOR A PURPOSE (to mate) which are the stronger.                                                                                 A grasshopper which mates exerts the most power: in some way, it's      existence is propagated further through history -- it makes more of a   difference on the world than a grasshopper which does not mate.  It     exerts more power.  Thus it satisfies it's "will" to power.                                                                                     All life is will to power.  And don't mean by "will" something          necessarily conscious.                                                                                                                                                                             Justin                                                                                       Re: Death                                                                                                                                       I am NOT assuming that "things must die in order for like in whole to   advance."                                                                                                                                       That would be a universal statement, and I have only made a more limitedstatement.                                                                                                                                      Instead, I have said that "SOMETIMES things must die in order for like  in whole to advance."  Which is a slightly different proposition.                                                                               And I have further said that, in those cases, it is better to die.                                                                              And actually that isn't quite accurate either, because I am not         concerned with "like in whole" -- I am concerned with whether or not it increases MY power, my prestige, my influence, and so forth.  Sometimes I can best increase my power, prestige and influence by dying.  And in  those cases, death is then the most natural choice.                                                                                             Re: If people were immortal, for example, a chemist could experiment        all his life producing all sorts of things.                                                                                                 I give you the counter-example: Galois.  Galois as you know, is one of  the most important persons in the entire field of mathematics, and was  responsible for whole new branches of mathematics coming into being, as well as other areas of study being finally closed (the search for a     formula for finding polynomials of degree > 5, for example).                                                                                    Did you know that all of Galois' work was done in just ONE NIGHT?  All  of his major contributions to mathematics were scribbled into his       notebook one night with "no time left.. no time left.." written         everywhere in the margins.                                                                                                                      Why?  Because he had been challenged to a dual, and was terrified that  he was going to die -- he wanted to get something done before his death.So in one night he scribbled everything into his notebooks, and         mathematicians have been busy ever since exploring the fruitful results of that single night.                                                                                                                           The next day he was shot and killed.                                                                                                            Would he have ever contributed so much had he not been afraid of death?                                                                                                                            Justin                                                                                       Re: You would not take your own life, nor would you encourage               anyone else to.                                                                                                                             I suggest that you would.  And if you would not, then it is a flaw, and not a strength in your character.

Would you give up your life in order to save theirs?                                                                                            If you would not, it is a weakness.  If you would.. well.. then I       suggest that in at least some cases, choosing to die is an action which affirms life, and is far more CREATIVE than choosing to live.

Do you mean that one  must admit everyone has different perspectives?  Do you mean that I     personally should change my perspective in some way?                                                                                            Here is a response if you mean something like this:                                                                                             "Truth", the "facts" are too many to be properly understood from just   one perspective.  And actually the facts will seem different when seen  from different perspectives.  In cases they may even seem opposite.                                                                             However -- giving up your own life and attempting to allow all          perspectives equal consideration is a bad option, because then you have given up everything that makes your own life worth living.                                                                                      Instead it is best to try and overcome yourself, and to rise to "higher"perspectives from which you can see more and more of life -- yet never  actually stopping and saying "Ok, I'm going to try and start seeing     everything the way everyone sees it."                                                                                                           In giving up your own perspective you go completely against your own    nature.  And since all values are created by human beings, since the    "worth" of everything, including life, is a human valuation, you are    really giving up your ability to create, and make value.  Either your   life will become worthless, or you will be condemned to spend the rest  of your life obeying other evaluations, and not your own.                                                                                                                                         Justin                                                                                        You think death is depressing because experiencing new things is what   makes you happy, and death means an end to those experiences.                                                                                   Actually -- isn't what actually makes you happy the fact that you have  increased your feeling of power?  By experiencing something new you haveexpanded yourself, and in some way become more powerful?                                                                                        Isn't happiness, in all cases, really just a feeling of having grown, ofhaving overcome something -- basically a feeling of victory?  A feeling of... power?                                                                                                                                    Then what is really the goal is not happiness, but actually increased   power -- a sign of which is happiness.  And don't mistake me here, I    don't just mean power as in control, I also mean, and primarily mean, a drive to overcoming.  The "spirit of overcoming" I described earlier.   All specific forms of power are just various methods which can be used  to overcome things, and only appropriate when required for the things   you wish to overcome.  So political power would be appropriate in only  some circumstances, etc., depending on what it is you wish to overcome.                                                                         Given all this, I advance the proposition that in some cases the best   way to overcome something is to die.  And therefore, death cannot be    viewed as an absolute enemy -- sometimes it is the best METHOD one can  use to satisfy the "spirit of overcoming", the "will to power", or the  "desire to grow" -- whatever name you want to give to this same thing.                                                                                                                                 Justin                                                                                   Do I believe in an afterlife?  No.  Once you die, you are dead.                                                                                 I think that an afterlife is a negative thing -- it is the statement    that what exists in the world is not worth enough, and everything I knowtells me that the world is worth more than enough, that it is           superlative.                                                                                                                                    Therefore, I see every statement that the world is not enough as a sort of nihilism.  Believing in an afterlife is a sort of nihilism.                                                                                                                                    Justin                Hmmm....would you have the number for the sanitarium?  Hehehe... Oh, I  guess I'm just being silly lately.  Yes, I guess I should have left the couple earlier; I was sort of in shock, and I wasn't sure that my       leaving would upset them (sounds egotistical, doesn't it? :-)                Steve                                                              You seem to miss the point that to exercise any power you gain by dying,you have to be alive.  Also, I don't agree that thre is no longer a     struggle to survive.  There are still millions of people in the world   dying of hunger, and even in this country there is suffering by many.   Perhaps it is now a struggle to survive with dignity, but it's still a  struggle.  re:praying mantises (not grasshoppers, to my knowledge).  Thefemale kills the male, which implies to me that the female is stronger  than the male, and the strongest survives.  I believe the female is MUCHlarger than the male.  I think the male is killed in order to give the  females' young a better chance of living, since there will be less      competition from further offspring from the male and other females.     There is also a tendency for animals, etc, to try to preserve their own genetic code over others (not consciously, obviously, just evolution).

Perhaps he would have been able to explain his thoeries in  more detail had he been ready to publish papers on his areas of study,  which would have saved modern scholors much time and energy.  And who isto say he would not have contributed even more than what he did that    night.  I don't think he thought it all up that night, he probably was  just writing it down in case he didn't live the next day.  And what did he die for?  A woman love, one who would stand by and watch men die for her.  Granted it may have been appropriate at the time, but he gained   very little from dying.  Had he lived, his work would still have been   known, and in greatter detail, I think.                                     Steve                                                               But I don't think dying is in any way overcoming a problem.  It's more  like wimping out.  Granted life is sometimes a drive for power.  Even ifit is a drive for less or simplicity, that still reflects a power over  your environment.  But again, you cannot exercise power from the grave  very well, and you certainly cannot gain more power or new experiences  once you are dead.  I guess it's all a matter of style and taste, but   when I go, I'm going kicking and screaming the whole way! :-)           (if I go, that is...there's always the experiment in the                basement.........come Igor!)

I do admit I think that pot is a drug and isn't good for you but I think what you are saying about it leading to coke is     ridiculous!!!                                                           This is definetly a sad day for hockey!!!!!                                                       Trouble with Zmodem                                                                                                           Is your line (telephone) bad to begin with?  Do you have troublewith other protocols?  Do you have call waiting? Do you turn it off?  I can probably figure it out if you tell me about your system.            Well, I think I you oughtta back into me as it only would be proper !   So, long time no see ( thank god ) !!  Homework hurts lots... I need    someone to massage my head !                                            True, true, true....  the legs I could handle, it is the shorts that    embarrassed me.  And, by the way, I did not show my bra (pink one,      wasn't it???) off, it was shown off without my help at all.                                                                                     Man, the Guys sure would like some sun!  Hasta la vista Baby!  See ya inBahamas wear I will see all the shorts I want.                          Yes, I do like that in swinwear, and I may get all of it this week.  I  am not going in search of the topless ones, however, I AM leaving for   the Bahamas on Sunday night (maybe Kim is coming, too!!!!) and I am surewe two will find pecs a plenty to admire.                               What do I look like?  A girl.. definately.. a girl.                     The #1 priority with my tastes in men is that the breath.. and bath     regularly, that is a good one, too.                                             re: comics                                                                                                                                      Sorry, it's been about two months since I have been on this BBS,since I lost the number, but the ole faithful computer kept my mail     waiting.                                                                                                                                                Now, regarding the collection of comic books.  I did up until   six months ago because i couldn't afford it anymore, now that I have a  job again, I plan to begin collecting again.                                                                                                            I admit, I collect mainly mainstream stuff.  When I stopped     collecting, my roster contained.  Excaliber, X-Men, Uncanny X-Men,      X-Factor, X-Force, Spiderman, Punisher, Punisher War Journal, Dark Hawk,Legends of the Dark Knight, Ghost Rider.  Then, I would collect all the Predator and Aliens stuff that came out and a few non mainstream titles as they caught my attention.                                                    Hey everyone, I just got on again after 2 months or so of being away since I lost the number to the BBS.                                         I had 1900 messages to go through.  I DON'T THINK SO!!  There  is no way I am going to sit through that many messages without being    able to abort or skip any of them.                                      I think you have it backwards.  I did not claim pot led to coke; I      poo-pooed the idea and said it did not.                                 Well BABES, I like k=hockey, but did I mention I also play baseball !   yep, one of the best third baseman around !  This Gruber guy makes me   laff !  You oughtta see me get down and dirty !  Well, the guy was too  OLD to be your son's friend !  Honestly, he was like 30 !  REALLY !  I  got him twice but not in a row !  So, will my favourite seat be warm ?  Best Third Baseman hey...well that is too bad you only made it to third base...???

Thanks!                                               Hmm...ok :  Peoplist ?  Masculinist ?  Can                              I be a masculinist and a feminist ? Can I be a                          Gender-Stereotyping Liberationist ?                                     I wish you weren't bashing Freud.  Everyone does, especially feminists. And I wish neo-freudians had apparently read Freud.                                                                                             You admire "willing to power"  so I don't understand why Freud is not   your hero.  I find his writing interesting from a literary point of     view, and suggestive from an artist's point of view, and what I like    MOST about Freud was his empowering of the patient.  He presumed that   patients know what they are doing, make sense, and can act with         volition [if only subconasciously...cures were effected by assisting thepatient in marrying subconscious intentions with conscious will].  Freudbelieved that people should do what they want, should know what they do.                                                                        Behaviorists, who are popular psychologists [forgive the pun] do not    have such faith in people.  Behaviorist theory appalls me because it    objectifies the "patient".                                              ...or maybe there is survival value in being weak, if you are a         grasshopper ?                                                           my interpretation of Gandhi's religious theorizing:                                                                                                  There are two kinds of truth.  One is the ultimate, real thing          that you learn if you are "enlightened" in the eastern classical        sense of the word "enlightened";  I am not so enlightened so I          resort to truth type 2, which is functional and only lasts until        I learn something.                                                                                                                         Gandhi told Neru something one day, and something else the next day.    When Neru questioned the Mahatma about this apparent discrepancy he     answered (I imagine) "What I told you yesterday was true.  What I told  you today is true.  I have learned something since yesterday".          The Maple Leafs aren't losers!  At least not anymore..  Yuppo..  With   Fletcher in town, the Leafs are kick'n ass.  That 10 player swap really paid off...                                                             I only have one thing to say..  GO LEAFS GO!!                           How about anarchist?  No catagories, just live and let live?            The real problem with Freud is that he made up all of his case studies, faked all of his results, and warped all his "facts" to fit his         theories.  There is pretty good evidence that the people of his case    studies did not even exist.                                                                                                                        Just because a theory is interesting does not mean that it is fact.  At least the behaviorists have produced a bit of empirical evidence.                                                                               As to objectifying, that is a requirement of theorization, if not of practice.  Personification simply muddies the water too much.  If I had a surgeon opperating on me, for example, I would just as soon he        remained highly objective and remote while I am on the table.  He can   save the emotionalism for his bedside manner.                           Actually, unless you are a real fan of Neitche the power freak and the  nazi's guru, life need not be a struggle for power.  The struggle       imposed by nature is not a struggle for power, but a struggle to        procreate and pass on the genes.  That is why the grasshopper dies, not for power.                                                                                                                                         People, though, have a higher intelligence than a grasshopper.  At   least some do.  People have the ability to choose what they want to     struggle for.  Many do.                                                 What do blondes and jello have in common ?                              they both wiggle when you eat them                                      What, you wanna skip the chair !  I thought the chair was rather        romantic.  But, hey whatever makes you happy !  I can play solid 3rd    base and well i'll prove it !  I dunno how, but i will !                Sex outside is no big deal.  I did it once in the middle of a path on   top of a cliff, in the middle of a meadow and in a Provincial Park underthe stars.                                                                                                                                      You've got to live a little sometimes.                                                                                                          Alex                                                                    Gee I don't think the Leafs are really going anywhere right now...      Oh well that's okay....Jays start today....                                          GO JAYS GO!!!                                              Okay  we will compromise...we will start on the chair ...then we will   try the floor...How does that sound .???!!!                             Honey I know you are solid ...you don't have to prove anything to me....        GO JAYS GO !!!!!!!!!!!                                          Oh I am coming honey...Do you want the little fan for a little blow or  the big  fan for a bigger blow?????                                     On second thought ...I am kinda busy tonight ..you know packing and     getting ready for Florida...so maybe you will have to come over to my   place and we can have a cold shower...???!!                             Well, can't say I                                                       (oops)  I've ever been caught by the police, although there have been   close calls with the parents :-)                                        15, eh? Geez, I didn't have fun                                         (damn!) 'til I was 20!  Hmmmm....  I was in Florida a few years ago and saw a few people out in the deeper water having fun - I think they      thought they couldn't been seen from shore (yeah, right!) ;-)  There arepeople on shore looking for just such an entising scene!                    Steve                                                               Well, it's good to know you are a verified female (;-)  Hmmm...I'll be  going to the bahamas in either May or July (not sure yet).  Too bad we  aren't going at the same time, could be fun (evil smirk).                    Steve                                                              What?  You mean waist length greasy hair isn't a turn on? :-)  hehehe   Well, I've been Mr. neat for quite a while and it hasn't don't much     good, unfortunately...I think I need a bit less of a clean look - more  of a slightly mussed Mel Gibson look.  Yeah, that's it!                      Steve                                                              Well, it all depends on whether you can find a partner who is able to   relax in that kind of scenario.  I think I would have fun.  It all      depends on who catches you.  Three more cute girls wouldn't be all that bad! :-)                                                                     Steve                                                              Re doing it in provincial parks.                                        Screwing while 10,000,000 mosquitoes bite my ass is not my idea of a    truly great time.  I'll take a motel room, thanks.                                                                                              Re: To exercise any power you have gained by dying you have to              be alive                                                                                                                                    Not true.  Perhaps in dying you save someone elses life -- and in no    other way could you have saved it -- then you have exerted a lasting    influence (well.. in human terms, lasting) and you have died.                                                                                   Another example -- let's go right back into history -- when Persia was  attempting to take over Greece, a group of Spartans blocked them at a   pass.  They managed to hold onto that pass for a few weeks, before they finally were annihilated by the immense Persian force.                                                                                          In the meantime, Greece set up its defenses, and the Persian army was   repelled when it arrived -- those Spartans exerted influence long after their death.                                                                                                                                    Another example -- the wide variety of people throughout history who    have become martyrs (in the true sense) for some cause or other.  They  exerted enormous influence long after their deaths.                                                                                             In all these cases it is quite easy to argue that the amount of power   exerted by these people at that time was far greater than they were     likely to have accomplished had they chosen a living course.                                                                                    To take a final example: how big a deal would Christianity be if that   Jesus guy had chickened out and run away instead of getting pegged to a tree?                                                                                                                                           RE: Grasshoppers -- male vs. female                                                                                                             Yes, the female is much larger than the male.  And perhaps the male doesbecome food for the young, I'm not sure about that.                                                                                             The point was concerning the males only, however.  Since a male         grasshopper who doesn't mate survives longer than a male grasshopper whodoes mate, WHICH of those two male grasshoppers is stronger?                                                                                    By your argument it would be the one who doesn't mate -- yet the genes  of that male vanish, and nothing survives after its death but a corpse  for some ants to munch on.  On the other hand, the male grasshopper thatmates -- and dies -- may change the course of grasshopper history.                                                                                                                                Justin                                                                                        RE: Galois -- had he lived his work would have been better known                                                                                Actually I doubt it.  Perhaps without the fear of death he would have   become a professor somewhere and pumped out the little bit of work      required to keep the job.  Before his death he didn't do a whole lot    that was very notable -- a few things, but not really any more things   than anyone else with a similar background.  He teamed up with a few    other people to prove some thigns, but in most of those cases he was thesecond name on the paper, not the first.                                                                                                        He no doubt would have become a moderately successful mathematician,    proving a few things, and disappearing into semi-oblivion as his        associates did --                                                                                                                               But who can say.  In any case, as the events did occur, that fear of    death was enough to establish him as one of the greatest mathematicians ever.

Name some instance     where it is not.  I will reduce it for you in terms of a drive for      power.  Take your pick -- religion?  morality?  politics?  philosophy?  day to day life?                                                                                                                                Even laziness.                                                                                                                                  Two things motivate everything human beings do: the desire to overcome  and fear.  And fear is really FEAR OF... losing power.

Nor was he any  nazi guru, except in the minds of a few British un-intellectuals.                                                                               Many people talk a lot about Nietzsche without ever having read him.    He's like Freud in that sense -- everyone thinks they know what he was  about without ever having picked up any of his books.                                                                                           In fact I'd be surprised if most people who have lengthy opinions about Nietzsche could even name one of his books.                                                                                                     Here are a few points you may not have known, in fact which you         obviously hadn't known --                                                                                                                       (1) Nietzsche was completely repulsed and disgusted by                      the anti-Semetic factions in Germany, which began growing               in size around the time he was writing (1860 - 1890).  He               used them repeatedly throughout all of his latter books                 as good examples of what he called "slave-like herd animals"            and cited them as classic examples of peoples whose lives               and values result from "ressentiment".                                                                                                          In the Genealogy of Morals he suggests that it might be a               good idea to throw the "anti-Semitic screamers" out of                  the nation lest they ever actually do cause harm to the                 Jews.                                                                                                                                           In that same passage he describes the Jews as the strongest,            purest race on earth.                                                                                                                       (2) Secondly, he wrote numerous passages condemning patriotism              and totalistic governments.  He suggests that any prediliction          to these sorts of things results from "bad digestion", and is           the sort of thing that any healthy person should get over in            a matter of hours.  In "Thus Spake Zarathustra", in the                 section entitled "Of Old Law Tables and New" he writes                  that one should not be concerned with ones "Fatherland",                but rather with ones "Childrens land"                                                                                                       (3) He hated Germans.  He disliked them intensely.  He thought              everything worthwhile about Germany had long sinced passed.             In every book there are numerous scathing attacks on the                German personae -- so much so that, once you have read                  Nietzsche, you will be more inclined to think him a                     racist than you were before -- only not because of his                  attitudes toward Jews (almost universally positive), but                because of his endless, even tedious, rantings and ravings              about how repulsive Germans are.                                                                                                            (4) What DID happen with Nazi Germany was the Nazis undertook               to rewrite a lot of Nietzsches works, and take quotations               so BADLY out of context that only someone who had never                 read ANYTHING by Nietzsche would be inclined to believe                 it.  Quotations so badly out of context that they managed               to turn a passage which praised Jews as the purest, most                healthy people currently in existence -- into a passage                 supporting anti-Semitism.  This also happens to be the                  same passage I cited above, where Nietzsche suggests that               anti-Semites be thrown out of Germany.                                                                                                      You can add Nietzsches name to the list of victims of Nazi Germany --   he was no Nazi guru, far from it -- he was exactly the opposite.        Some fifty years after he lost consciousness (in 1888 -- he died in     1900) his lifes work got chewed up and spit out, in hideous form, by theNazi propaganda machine -- as did so many other works.                                                                                                                                            Justin                                                                                        Re: Freud..                                                                                                                                     I'm not bashing him.  Merely stating a fact:                                                                                                    People tried to prove, empirically, that his theories were the truth.   They turned out not to be the truth, so people came up with different   theories.                                                                                                                                       So far, nobody has hit on anything which is the truth.  But what        theories are now currently under consideration fair better in empirical analysis than do Freuds.                                                                                                                        Re: Drive for power, you think Freud should be my idol                                                                                          Other way around.  My ideas about power come largely from Nietzsche.    Freud read Nietzsche, and developed many of his theories based on his   reading of Nietzsche.                                                                                                                           There are a lot of misconceptions about this: Nietzsche, and not Freud, was the first to use the word "sublimated" in its modern sense.         There are other examples --                                                                                                                     And Freud isn't oriented around a drive for POWER.  He bases his        theories around a sexual drive.  It's close.. but:                                                                                                                                                                      The power drive I'm talking about is not so much a NEED.  It is not a   reaction to things.  It is not a reaction to any stimulus, and it is notanything physical in origin like a sublimated sex drive.  It is back    behind that -- back behind even evolution.  You could say that the driveI am talking about when I say "power" is the same force pushing         evolution: the simple desire to overcome everything.                                                                                            Let me phrase it this way: The same drive that makes an amoeba eat      everything in sight also explains all human behavior.                                                                                                                                                Justin                                                                                     Re: Behaviorists                                                                                                                                By the way -- behaviorism doesn't hold much water with modern psych.    either.  Behaviorists managed to prove that simple autonomic nerve      responses could be conditioned, and that rats and pigeons could be      conditioned, but they have never had much success in explaining any of  the interesting things people do.                                                                                                               Behaviorists / Freud are very well known in the general population, but both are about 30-40 years out of date in the real literature.  They    constitute about 90% of "pop psychology" but only about 10% of academic psychology.                                                                                                                                                                                            Justin           I meant you could "juggle" as amny perspectives as you are a capable of.Holding to some "higher" perspective is too narrow for me. I like to    observe that which has already been created and try to understand it    through as large a range as possible. I think you are hinting to me thatone loses your self by not choising your own. I feel that is a danger,  but you shouldn't make yourself blind to other perspectives because you are trying to protect your own. You can a have a self and still view    from another's point of view.                                           "may change the course of grasshopper history"                          Why should that grasshopper consciencely choose to attempt to change thecourse of grasshopper history?                                          I meant that ALL male praying maintises are weakert physically than     females.  Or they willingly get into a position of vulnerability.       Anyways, I think the whole point of it it that some people would like tobe martyrs, and others don't.  I don't think many of those soldiers     enjoyed dying.  Is was their job.  It's all personal preference.  I put my own life ahead of a lot of other things.  I mean, what did the       soliders gain?  perhaps they helped one side, but they harmed the other. And the empire fell anyway, so in the end the defense was worth naught. It just delayed the fall.                                              You missed the point.  No one could have some up with what he did in a  few hours.  It was his life's work.  He just didn't have it documented  until he felt that he was in peril.  There are things that he didn't    explain clearly enought before he died that would have been nice to     know, which he could have written in his leisure if he had lived.       Actually, religeon appears to be a drive to give your will away - a     definite loss of power, so to speak.  Total freedom is as close to totalpower as you can get.  I don't think that 'power                         is a very appropriate term here.  But I think you know what I mean.    Some people want to be remembered for how they affected the world -     other's don't.  There is a limit in each individual as to how much      'power' they need to feel complete.  Everyone is different.  Some peopleonly want to have their touch felt by those who are close; anything elseis irrelevant.  If I became a martyr for something I would have done    anyways, well, fine.  If I didn't, fine.  The point is I'd live my life the same way no matter what the results were.  It just doesn't interest me.  The cappability of having a few friends and a decent job is all the'power' I desire.                                                       Well, after seeing Basic instinct I got a few more idea's !  You don't  have an Ice Pick in the house do you ?????  Well, i must say, after     finding out we don't have an ice pick here at home, i slept very well.  God the BABES in that movie were WOWEEEEE !!                                            Jays WON !!!                                            What the HECK !!!! How come you don't talk like this when I'm over there!  Shit, i'm getting Nausea's !  Well, i forgot to call, forgive me.....about the cold shower, i didn't get any tips from Michael Douglas on    that one !  Holy Smokes.... that movie was well good and eduactional !  BTW, do you use handcuffs or scarfs.                                    Ya, that was me.  I had totally forgotten about the problem because I   already handed in the assignment but I am still interested in what you  have to say (in case you've forgotten, we're talking about the          determinant problem).                                                                                                                           Thanx                                                                                                                                           Dwayne King                                                             Re Neitche:                                                             To accuse me of not having read his works (or even to infer it) is      somewhat much on your behalf.  I have indeed read him, albeit not in 25 years or so.                                                                                                                                           I am well aware that Neitche was not an anti-semite.  I never    said he was --- that is pure defensivism on your behalf.  I said he was the Nazi guru, which he was.  That he did not like the nazi's is quite  beside the point.  I am quite sure that Marx would have been horrified  at the Soviet Union of the mid 80's as well.                                                                                                          What he claimed was that there was absolutely no basis for        morality, that all life was simply a quest for power.  The Nazi's lived by that philosophy, and adopted it for their own.  That the adoption of a philosopy lead to one of the cruelest, inhumane eras in history can   not, indeed, be laid on the head of the philosopher.  But it can        certainly give one reason to suspect a flaw in the philosopy.           What????                                                                I have some more QB and C questions that (I hope!) someone can answer   for                                                                     me.  I am working on a project that involves calling C functions from   QB.  Here goes:                                                                                                                                 a)  How do the C functions get declared ("prototyped") from the QB side?                                                                        ie.  C prototype for a sample function:                                         int boo(char g, char *st, int foo);                                                                                                     What declarations of this type are available in QB?  What are the data  types?                                                                                                                                          b)  How does QB pass strings?  By address, ie. char *?                                                                                          c)  How does a data type have to be returned to QB?                         Are integers returned in a certain register, etc.?                      How are strings returned?                                               Does QB support structures?  How can I return a C structure and have    it accessed from QB?                                                                                                                        I almost think that I should buy QB to do this!  The person I'm doing   this for doesn't know much and can't lend me their manual.  Annoying...                                                                         Thanks for any help.                                                                                                                            Andy Stedman                                                            ThankYou  for letting me know about the tax file. Have a good day!      Where are you going in Bahamas?  WE were in Nassau and it was           incredible.  Have you been before?  I was stunned at the clarity of the ocean....  God, I already wish I was back there... sigh.                As for you being there at the same time.. wee-elll, Kim and I managed tofind enough trouble of our own to get in.. ask her about the wet suit.                                                                          Well -- I just finnished writing an exam in which I had to use          determinants, so I refreshed myself.  And I realized what would be your best approach when I was doing this --                                                                                                          Write something which can do what is called the "Lower Gaussian         algorithm" .. it's not hard, and if you want me to tell you the steps I will.. it's basically the same algorithm you use to do simple           solutions.. just a minor change on the usual Gauss-Jordan algorithm.                                                                            Anyways.. turn your whole matrix into a lower triangular matrix, or an  upper triangular matrix.. in other words, a matrix where everything     above or below the main diagonal is zero..                                                                                                      Then the determinant equals the product of all the entries on the main  diagonal.  Just multiply a11 x a22 x a33 x ... x ann                                                                                            And there you have it.  It's simple to code, and it's fairly fast as    well.                                                                                                                                                                                                Justin                                                                                     ps: You can use the usual Gauss algorithm, but then you have to             also include a few simple rules: if you interchange two rows,           you multiply the determinant you get by -1.. if you multiply            a row by a constant, then you must divide the final result              by that constant.. a few other simple things like this.                                                                                     RE: Perspectives...                                                                                                                             The danger is that, if you give up your own perspective, you give up    your ability to create your OWN things.  To be a creator of things in   your own right.                                                                                                                                 You become merely an observer of what other people have accomplished andbuilt up.. be it a world view, or a more tangible accomplishment.                                                                               You do not become the originator of anything.                                                                                                   Giving up your own perspective and viewing the world from someone elses is like the difference between playing a game, and merely being a       spectator.                                                                                                                                                                                           Justin                                                                                     Re: Why should the grasshopper choose to change the course of              grasshopper history --                                                                                                                       My point was that, in the scheme of things, the grasshopper that ended  up getting killed was more important than the grasshopper who saved his skin.                                                                                                                                           As an analogy, that is meant to indicate that quite often in the scheme of things, an accomplishment which ends in or involves death may often  be greater and more significant than one that does not.                                                                                                                                         Justin                                                                                          Re: What did the soldier gain --                                                                                                                Depends what soldier and in what context.  I think there are all sorts  of people throughout history who you must admit changed several         thousands of years of history by choosing to die for something.                                                                                 Those who died in the effort to repel Xerxes invasion of Greece, for    example, kept Greece free long enough to lay down the foundations for   democracy in Athens.                                                                                                                            And there are others, who were not soldiers, throughout history who     died, and in dying changed history.                                                                                                             The final point is this -- given an individual X: that individual X     exerts a certain amount of power throughout their lifetime.  As comparedwith some King or hero in history, this power and influence is probably slight.                                                                                                                                         But for X, whatever that influence and power is, it may STILL be the    case that it is greater through death than not through death.  X may    accomplish more of whatever it is X is doing through death.                                                                                     Or X may not.. who knows?  Only X really --                                                                                                     I am not suggesting everyone should go out and kill themselves.  What I am saying is merely that in SOME CASES it is the right choice.                                                                                  Hence it is not ALWAYS wrong.  Personal preference?  Sure -- but then   this means you cannot say suicide is always wrong.                                                                                                                                                   Justin                                                                                     Re: Some people are only interested in whether their touch is felt          by those close to them                                                                                                                      This goes along completely with what I have said so far.  When I say    "power" and "influence", I MOST CERTAINLY do not mean just political    power and political influence.                                                                                                                  Power of ALL sorts.  I have defined ALL OF LIFE in terms of power.      Political power is just one particular, and rather small, example.                                                                              RE: Most religion seems to be a definite loss of power                                                                                          True.  Most is.  In fact, one can take this beyond just religion:       most METAPHYSICS involves a definite loss of power.                                                                                             Or perhaps -- and I think this most likely -- those who are losing      power, those who are degenerating, and losing the ability to influence  things and create things -- are attracted to religion.                                                                                          By create things, losing power, in this sense I mean specifically the   CREATIVE instincts, and the will to power in its most direct form: the  passions.                                                                                                                                       I think most religions are full of a lot of RESSENTIMENT -- people who  are not passionate, who are not filled with a desire to overcome        everything, who resent those who ARE passionate, who do demonstrate a   great vitality and will to live: and so they formulate moralities       condemning people who are passionate, desire to overcome things, etc.                                                                           Hence prohibitions against the sex drive, against greed, and everything else associated with desire and the will to power.                                                                                                                                                   Justin             re: graphics functions in MSC 6.0 don't work                                                                                                      Simple problem, simple solution: When you installed the compiler you  told it not to include the graphics libraries in the standard libraries.You can either re-install the whole thing, but this time including the  graphics libaries, use the library manager to include the graphics      libraries, or make sure to include the graphics library when linking theprogram by including it on the command line. The libary you need it     probably called "GRAPHIC.LIB, GRAPHICS.LIB, or "GRAPH.LIB". If it's not on your harddisk (in the "LIB" subdirectory) you'll have to copy it fromthe libary disks.                                                       Stange (public) places: Well, yes and no. Last year during treeplanting we both got a bit too drunk and ended up in somebody else's tent, but hewasn't there at the time.

They shouldn't be back until about midnight.  Wrong, Life is not always a drive for power. It depends on the person I guess, 'cause for me it's just a quest for fun. To hell with power!                                                                             (1) --                                                                                                                                          What the Nazi's claimed Nietzsche said, and adopted as their philosophy,and what Nietzsche actually said were two ENTIRELY different things.                                                                            To suggest that Nietzsche was a "Nazi Guru" because the Nazis took his  philosophy and distorted it beyond recognition -- to the point of       telling blatant lies about it -- is absurd.                                                                                                     If I took all of your statements out of context, and used them to       construct a totalitarian philosophy, and proceeded to kill millions of  people on this basis -- would that make you a "guru"?                                                                                           No: All it would mean was that someone had been telling a lot of lies   about what you had said.                                                                                                                        (2) --                                                                                                                                          For me to believe that you had not read Nietzsche is entirely           reasonable, given your gross and total ignorance of what he actually    said.  There are only two types of people who believe that Nietzsche waspart of the foundation of the Nazi movement, a "guru" as you put it:                                                                            (a) people who have not read and understood what Nietzsche wrote        (b) people who have something to gain by misleading people                                                                                      Since I assume you have nothing to gain by misleading people, it must bethat either you have not read Nietzsche, or you read Nietzsche but only casually, and didn't really understand what you were reading.                                                                                   The latter is very forgivable -- one of Nietzsche's "flaws" is that he  did not go to any great lengths to make himself easy to understand.  He wrote in a series of aphorisms which can only be understood if read     slowly, carefully, and in sequence -- whereas most people assume they   are just fragments of wisdom which can be grasped quickly, and in any   order (a completely false belief).                                                                                                                                                                   Justin                                                                                     I will outline just a few of the relevant differences between Nietzsche and the Nazi movement --                                                                                                                                                                                                (1) The Nazis were a populist movement.  Nietzsche thought that             anything populist was necessarily worthless.                                                                                                (2) The Nazis were anti-Semites.  Nietzsche thought that all                such racism sprang from ressentiment, and that persons with             such large amounts of ressentiment were wretched, base, and             worthless.                                                                                                                                  (3) Nietzsche was a protaginist for Aristocracy.  The Nazis were            the furthest thing from aristocratic.  Rather, they attempted           to set up a dictatorship based on the popular support of the            masses, whose opinions and support would be considered less             than worthless in an aristocracy.                                                                                                           (4) Nietzsches concept of the Ubermensch was intended to mean that          there is always a way to improve the human race -- it will never        be perfect, it will never be "pure" -- the perfect man will             always be the man of the day after tommorow, and one should             never stop striving for improvement.                                                                                                            The Nazis on the other hand, presented themselves as the final          product, the pure race, and considered that they were the               Ubermensch -- which is something Nietzsche describes in his             books (see Zarathustra's Prologue) as "Ultimate Men" -- people          who sacrifice the future for the present.  The Ultimate Man,            in other words the Nazi ideal, Nietzsche described as                   "the most contemptible man of all."                                                                                                         (5) Nietzsche attacked all moral absolutes as mere matters of               perspective, constructed by societies for purely power                  oriented reasons.  He set himself "beyond good and evil"                in order to observe it.  The Nazis on the other hand were               the worst sorts of moralists, dictating all sorts of moral              absolutes and considering themselves to have a hold of                  universal Truth, with a capital T.  In other words -- just              the opposite of Nietzsche, yet again.  Above all else, the              Nazis were VERY Christian, and VERY moral.  People like to              forget this, after discovering what atrocities can be done              by very moral men -- far TOO moral men: men who were so sure            of their right and others wrong that they had no qualms in              killing millions.                                                                                                                           (6) The Nazis held ideals about the State, and about Fatherlands.           Nietzsche condemned the State in no uncertain terms (see                Zarathustra, "Of the New Idol") and wrote that it would be              better to do one in the name of ones "Childrens land" than in           the name of ones "Fatherland" -- in other words that one does           not owe respect and a debt to the society that gave one what            one has -- on the contrary, one should hold it in contempt for          not being better, for being so small, and low.  Something               completely alien to the totalitarian Nazi concept of the                State - which must necessarily be idolized.                                                                                                 I think, Donald, before you go about making such grand and arrogant     statements as "Nietzsche was a Nazi Guru" -- I think you should at      least know what you're talking about.                                                                                                                                                           Justin                  Does anyone know of a COBOL compiler for a PC.  If so please leave a    msg. in E_MAIL.. Thanx                                                  I'll be there in mid-July.  I went there once before with three guys    from University.  Pretty interesting trip :-)  Hmmmm, wet suit, eh?     Sounds kinky!  I really liked the ship-ride over to the islands (from   Florida).  The water was a really nice blue, and there were flying fish!And there was a cute little shark when we went snorkeling.                   Steve                                                              Well, re:suicide being wrong - I really believe that anyone should be   able to do what they want, as long as no harm is done to others in the  act.  It all depends on whether you think a suicide hurts someone       (besides the person doing it) ie - family, friends, etc.                Now that would have been interesting to see.  Hard to explain :-)       So, how was the treeplanting thing - I've heard a bit about it, but not too much.  It sounds like a lot of work (doesn't bother me, though).    Did you get paid enough to make it worth it?  Were there women? hehehe       Steve                                                              So, what's all this about a wet suit, eh?  Sounds interesting!  Did you wear it or was it a guy you two were oggling, hmmmnn?  If you were      wearing it, did you get pics? :-)  I'll be going to the Bahamas in      mid-July...too bad we didn;t go at the same time.  OH well.  (sigh). :-)     Steve                                                              you want someone to massge your head? hmmmmm...i will do it for you!    can i? huh?                                                             no, i don't have a child...and as for giving up my life for my child's idon't know if i would or not, as i don't know what it is like to be a   parent!                                                                 so you don't beleive in an afterlife...can i assume that you don't      beleive in god? are you one of those scientific people that if you can'tsee it, then you don't believe in it? do you believe in the big bang    theory?                                                                 i beleive in god and the aferlife, but i am not a bible thumping        fanatic, i think everyone is entitled to beleive what they want and i amnot one to try and convert!                                             not only did you see all the shorts you wanted, you saw a great wetsuit and g strings to boot!                                                  ahhhh the wetsuit! sigh his name was owen and was a local and looked    mighty fine in that body hugging piece of rubber!                               Gee, I don't know if computers are as responsive to the poetry  of programing languages as people are to poetry - although I agree with the connection you made to the linguistic elements of the electronic    world and that of the artistic expression of poets (and programers). I  think that when word processors came out the writers that used them at  first discovered that using the computer changed their writing          dramaticaly - no more little note books and such. I find it hard to     compose on the computer because I'm used to using little bits of paper  and there is a difference between the flow of writing by hand and typingon a keyboard. I think that word processing makes writing a more processoriented activity and tends to place the writer at a greater distance   from their work. With the way the publishing industry is going though   the electronic media and the bbs scene is one alternative of getting    one's work to an audience and at least providing a forum for the        literary arts beyond the eletist regiemes set up by the accademies. I   think that there is a tremendous potential through computers and bbs's  for literatures to evolve and reach a wider readership although I wonderabout the process of creation, revision, etc.. with the use of these    tools - It reminds me of print-making and photography in a way. I have  done both and found that the technical aspects and the whole process    detracted from the experience of the work more often than not...        Hmmm...now that you mention it, Gauss-Jordan does ring a bell.  I       haven't looked at my matrix algebra text in a while - I'll have to      refresh myself on the quickest way to make a matrix into an upper/lower triangular one.  Thanks a bunch!                                                                                                                Dwayne King                                                             I've heard THAT before.                                                 I agree with you that the word processor changes the way that you write.One of the worst tendancies that is fosters is a great tendancy to      overwrite.  However, once you are used to it, I think that it can       improve your writing style.  The ability to revise as you go, and       restructure a piece evolves a style of "building" rather than writing.  It is quite different.                                                  There are several.  I am using Microsoft, but micro-focus is also quite good.                                                                   Justin, I have recntly been scanning some of the items on this base, andI have noticed a distinct tension or three in your arguments.           1.  You excoriate others for the IRRATIONAL fear of death, yet embrace  as strong a society where we all act upon our EMOTIONS.  This is        inconsistent.                                                           2.  You mention that Freud is held in disrepute by current psychology.  Partly correct; many of his ideas have been abandoned, but many still   remain dominant.  Refer to Erikson, or any number of other prominent    psychologists to see the prevalence of his influence.                   3.  Addendum to point 2:  Freud is held in more esteem by psychologists than Nietzsche is by philosophers.  Feel free to apply an empirical teston the societies which have embraced his concepts.                      4.  If there can be no evil, what basis would you have for opposing     Hitler, Stalin, Duke etc.  They certainly did their best to make their  societies 'stronger', and they certainly disdained (disdain) rational   thought, exchanging it for 'what works'.                                5.  If we are to encourage suicide, as a noble final act of pure        emotional power, what basis would any of us have to stop this person if he or she also decided that they would shoot you first, then turn the   barrel upon themselves? Perhaps some of us (overcome by all-powerful    emotion, of course), would simply decide that the world will be         'stronger' in this way, and therefore we should simply step aside.      A further extrapolation of your logic would be embracing what Marc      Lepine did-gee, that was pretty noble, now wasn't it?                   FSW                                                                                                                                             RE: It all depends on whether you think a suicide hurts someone                                                                                 Whether it hurts someone is irrelevant.  This morality you have, that itis best to hurt as few people as possible, is really very strange.  Why would you want to do that?  What value is there in not hurting people?                                                                          This concept that the "ideal" is a world in which noone is hurt and     everyone is free from fear -- this is a concept worked up by those who  are weak, and resent those who are strong.  It is the revenge of the    weak against the strong.  Those who are UNABLE... resenting those who   are ABLE.. and so making up rules to bring the able down.                                                                                       It smells of resentment.                                                                                                                        It smells of people who are so weak and afraid that they are terrified  of what their neighbour might do to them, and so make up rules requiringthe neighbour to be nice.  I think I prefer a system which does not     impose such silly limits on those who are full of life.                                                                                         Life is NOT about avoiding pain.  Life is about overcoming things,      succeeding, growing...                                                                                                                                                                                 Justin                                                                                   No, I am not one of those scientific people who doesn't believe it if I can't see it.  Don't imagine that everyone who doesn't believe in God   must be fit in to some little narrow stereotype.                                                                                                I wouldn't even call myself an athiest, because it has come to mean so  many things -- like a dedication to rationality.  I am NOT dedicated to rationality, and I do NOT believe in God.                                                                                                       I am dedicated to all the growth, and passion, and everything irrationalabout life -- to the instinctual and the impulsive desires which are    really the source of everything human.  And not science.  And not       rationality.  And not God.                                                                                                                      God and rationality are tools of the weak who are too afraid to face    themselves.  Athiests are so afraid of their own passions that they mustbind themselves to rationality so as to avoid them.  Christians are so  afraid of their passions that they must construct moralities to crush   them.  I am neither.                                                                                                                            And I think so much of the world, and of life, and everything that is,  that I will not devalue it by suggesting it isn't enough -- that there  must be something after it to make it worthwhile.                                                                                                                                                    Justin                                                                                     (1) --                                                                                                                                          "Irrational fear of death" vs. "Non-rationality" -- this is not such a  tension as you imagine.  It is me using the word rationality in         different senses -- probably an error, but only one of rhetoric, and notstructure.                                                                                                                                      I do not think that rationality is something which should be stamped outand got rid of.  Rather I think it is a useful tool -- but a tool used  by the passionate/instinctual aspects of living things: not something   which should be in control.                                                                                                                     As to the supposed conflict here -- I should perhaps said "unnatural"   instead of "irrational".  One only fears death because one has lost     sight of what life is worth -- the passions do not fear death, the      passions think only about growing, expanding, overcoming... what fears  death is the rational mind which has lost the value of life.  Which has lost sight of the fact that value IS overcoming -- and that there is    nothing inherent in "death" which prohibits overcoming NOW.                                                                                     The fear of death is a VERY rational thing -- which is the flaw in it.  So I made a mistake in calling it irrational.                                                                                                   (2) Freud held in disrepute --                                                                                                                  By and large as you said, this is true.  He is not a dominant force in  psychology any more, nor has he been in quite sometime.  However I don'tthink people would say "disrepute" because a great deal is owed to Freudfor starting us on the road that got us where we are now.                                                                                       And I realize there are still a few people around who talk about Freud. They are actually quite a minority: perhaps 10%.  But they do exist.                                                                            (3) Freud held in disrepute vs. Nietzsche in disrepute                                                                                          You assume that my comment on Freud was a CRITICISM.  Not so.           Someone mentioned Freud as if Freud was the dominant force in psychologyand I corrected them -- it was nothing more than that.                                                                                          And Nietzsche has ALWAYS been held in disrepute by philosophers, who forthe most part cannot accept the fact that it is possible to be a        philosopher AND have a wit, AND write well, AND avoid being tedious,    drawn out, and boring.  In his books everywhere he notes (with a certainamount of glee) just how much people dislike his philosophy.                                                                                    That is no argument against it.  In terms of what he said, and his      attack on all things popular, it is actually an argument FOR it.                                                                                (4) If there can be no evil, what basis can I have for opposing             Hitler and Stalin                                                                                                                           OK.  Now it gets more sticky.  Nietzsche was not a "guru" of these sortsof people, but on the other hand he certainly never made any points     which would condemn them.  He is neutral in this respect.                                                                                       And I suppose I am probably neutral in this respect too.  I guess the   thing I am most curious to know is, although I certainly see no reason  for supporting such people, why are you so eager to oppose them?                                                                                What underlying moralities do you hold which lead you to oppose them?   What foundation do you have for this belief?  And where did that        foundation come from?                                                                                                                           (5) If suicide is one final act of emotional power, what is to stop         someone from turning the barrel on me first, then themselves.                                                                               NOTE THIS: I never suggested that I was interested in "stopping" anyone.Nor did I suggest that suicide was ALWAYS a *valuable* thing.  Nor did Isuggest that I was going to stop people from doing worthless things.                                                                            The point was that in some situations it can be a life-affirming,       valuable thing.  In other situations it may not be.  I made no absolute claim either way.                                                                                                                               The other thing to say here is this: "Life" is no argument -- that      certain truths may be dangerous to know does not make them false, any   more than something becomes false just because we dislike it.                                                             -Justin                                                                                       A few more additional comments to touch on things you mentioned         obliquely --                                                                                                                                                                                                            First... *society* becoming stronger is NOT what I said was valuable.   It is in the passions of individuals that value and strength lie.  Do   not make the mistake of assuming I am speaking of specifically politicalpower here.  Certainly political power would be included.. but only as  one thing among many, and not even nearly important.                                                                                            So arguments like "so-and-so made society stronger..." are not argumentssuggesting that so-and-so was worthwhile.  What is valuable, from       so-and-so's point of view, is that so-and-so became stronger.                                                                                   Actually arguments "this is good because it works.." in the Utilitarian sense are something I oppose.  Generally they rest on universal truths  (like "It is always good to help the most number of people") and these  necessarily limit the spirit of overcoming in individuals who are       expected to second themselves to these universal things.                                                                                                                                                                Second... a further extrapolation of this logic would NOT lead to anyonecalling Marc Lepine noble.  In fact just the opposite.  We would say    that Marc Lepine acted out of RESSENTIMENT.. which I think is something clear to event he biggest idiot.. and RESSENTIMENT is the furthest thingfrom Noble.                                                                                                                                     Marc Lepine resented the fact that women were gaining power, and        perceived himself as being in some way weak because of it.  His act was based out of a general fear and insecurity as to his own ability: a     general feeling of impotence.  And, even if only in a small way, he     wished to cause as much harm to those who WERE growing, succeeding,     overcoming obstacles and so on.. RESSENTIMENT.                                                                                                  Ressentiment is a product of weakness, of decline, of degenerating      spirit.  Something contemptible, produced by those who are contemptible.                                                                        What is NOBLE is to be growing, succeeding, victorious.. hardly things  you would associate with ressentiment, impotence, and decline.                                                                                  In fact the two are mutually exclusive.

You're just going at the wrong time of the year.  Last year I was there in late August and there was narry a 'sqeeter to be found.

The best time to go is after July 15 or so for bugs, and after september10 for temperature.

Her eyes held the answer                                                I kissed her cheek                                                      then left.                                                              I stand alone                                                           on a cliff overlooking the sea                                          watching the waves                                                      carrying their comforting message                                       Who do you love?

Mace.                                                                           I also use cakewalk as a type of compositional tool at times tooand I think that what you said about "building" is right on the mark    when it comes to Midi. I play guitar so the keyboard is just another    tool to me and I don't really see it as an instrument - if I played     keyboard I obviously would! I find that the computer or sequencer is    wonderful that way because music is one of those things that comes and  goes more so than writing fiction or poetry does for me. I work on a    composition and punch it in as I go but I hear it instantly on replay - when I take it to the guitar when I'm satisfied with what I have the    work changes and becomes more organic in that sense. I have to modify   the piece specifically for guitar and each time I play it myself it is  different. The same process is not true of wordprocessing - even the actof transcription or revision seem rather static processes of setting    things down in concrete for me on the computer. I'm a paper kind of     person I guess - I like things to be organic. I can read something on   the screen and want it on paper before I do my final editing. It is sortof like playing the piece on the instrument it was meant for....                What do you think about computers and music?                    Sure, U can !  So what's this I hear about the Bahamas ???  You went anddidn't tell me !  I'm MAD !!!!!!!!!!!   I'm gonna KILLLLLL!!!!!!        Oh good you got some new material...???  I was starting to get tired of the same old thing.....Hey Looks aren't everything  you know...I think  it is all in how you use what you got...  Ice Picks...mmmm  ... I 'm notgoing to tell you ?????????                                             No problem I think I will forgive you this once for not coming over whneyou were supposed to..                                                  Gee that must of been some movie...I think I better go see it...Do you  think I will really learn anything though....???!!!                     I think we have gotten a little off topic...                            this is the sports section ..right..??                                  I guess that could be classified as a sport???                          s                                                                       Yes well, i'm sure you will have a hard time getting used to the new    routines, but i'm sure your a litlle swifter than the average SENIOR ! Iknow you don'thave an ice pick cuz Kathy already told me !              Well, I think you should go see it !  BUT I ain't going again !  ONCE   was enuff !  I don't think you will learn much but rather refine the    skills you already posess, and possibly get those rusty parts back in   gear !  So, i forgot to ask, when i was over last week, where's the     Lincoln ????                                                            Aw, darn it!  So there were no females in wetsuits?  Hmmmm....          Oh well.  So, how do you feel about modelling a wetsuit? :-)            Gee, If the people who dp all this are weak, how do they do it?  Sounds like they're not weak, they merely oppress those who think they are     stong, but really aren't.  As for believing people shouldn't be hurt,   it's called being human.  People without consciences should be the firstthing we should get rid of.  Makes everyone miserable and serves no     purpose.  Having concern for others is an indication of a greater       understanding and acceptance of reality.  A further step is to feel the whole of society must be protected - see Martin Luther King Jr.  Most   people do not progress this far, but most do not hurt others out of     carelessness.  A really feel your view of others is really apathetic.   If you have no concern for my and other's wellfare, society may         eventually step in and take care of the problem.  You can't go through  life without thinking about others.  At least, if you want to get       anywhere.  Understanding people is a strength, as well as having allies.If you don't care about these thing, it's your loss.                                                                                            Re: How can people who are weak impose a morality                                                                                               As a collective.  Isn't that obvious?  Weak/Strong are relative terms.  But many weak can probably exert more force than a few strong.  And in  this case have.                                                                                                                                 The mass majority of people are full of ressentiment at their inability,impotence, and so forth, and wish to impose restrictions on those who   succeed, grow, and conquer.  And there are enough in the majority to    make their ressentiment a strong force.                                                                                                         Re: As for believing that people shouldn't be hurt -- it's called           being human                                                                                                                                 No.  It's called being an impotent human.  Another characteristic of themajority is that they view themselves as the ONLY sort of acceptable    human beings.  Herd morality defines itself as the only morality -- a   very intolerant, inflexible morality which attacks anything which might be or become strong, growing and vibrant.                                                                                                       I suggest to you that the only reason you think that "people shouldn't  be hurt" is a Universal Truth (capital T) is because you have blinders  on, and have not permitted yourself to see the larger picture -- WHERE  does this idea of yours come from?  Isn't it from a fear of being hurt?                                                                         Re: People without consciences should be the first thing that we            get rid of                                                                                                                                  You throw these words around like you know what they mean.  so let me   ask you: WHAT is a conscience?  And WHY should it be valuable?                                                                                  I suggest to you that a conscience is merely the collective of all moralimperatives that you have got bred into you, either by socialization or by any other method.  Hence it is not any Universal Truth (capital T) atall, just a collective *OPINION* -- but an opinion held so deeply that  you aren't aware of it as such... or rather weren't, until now.                                                                                 Re: Having concern for others indicates a greater acceptance of             reality                                                                                                                                     True.  But this does not mean having pity on them.  It means including  other people as factors you must deal with in your life.  If these otherpeople wield some force, then one must be respect it as being a force.                                                                          RE: My view is apathetic                                                                                                                        Just the opposite.  My view espouses growth, strength and vitality.     YOUR view stresses passivity, sleepy security, unchallenging and        mediocre people who are no threat to anyone.. WHO is apathetic here?                                                                                                                              Justin                Like I said, allies are better than enemies.  Ans the fact that 'the    weak' are able to impose on others means they are strong, and not weak  at all.   I think that time is better spent working on improving our    standard of living than on figuring out how to harm others.  Society hasit's rules.  You must obide by them to a certain degree or be punished. Either that or change the society.  But if the majority opposes you, you  Lose.  I don't think your views are compatible with the               society we live in.  Which means you are outnumbered and, by your own   interpretation, you will be oppressed.  Which is fine by me - I don't   think I like the idea of someone without a conscience roaming around.   I'm sure you can find somewhere to live where you'll be accepted        How bout San Quentin? :-)  But I can see that our viewpoints are pretty much irreconscilable, so I don't see much point in continuing this      argument.                                                               Help! Need software to convert Wang formated files to WP5.1 does        anything exist? I would really appreciate.                              Thank you                                                                                                                                       Re: The fact that the weak are able to impose on the strong means           that they are not weak                                                                                                                      Yeah right.  And I suppose that you think that 100 convalescents are    strong because if they all ganged up on one WWF champ they could kick   his butt.                                                                                                                                       Let us refer to the weak man as the "herd man".  The herd man is weak.  Impotent.  Afraid even of himself.  Terrified of his neighbour.                                                                                 So the herd man forms into a herd.  The herd, the collective force of   all herd men, is fairly strong and powerful.                                                                                                    The herd enforces things which make each of the weak, impotent members  of the herd feel safer, more secure, less afraid.  It decrees that      people must have pity on one another.  It decrees that being power      hungry is wrong.  It decrees that showing extremes of passion is unholy.It decrees all sorts of things which strike out at the strong and seek  to make them impotent too.                                                                                                                      It would like to bring the strong down so that they no longer have the  ability to harm the weak.                                                                                                                       Now -- here's the point you're missing -- the HERD is strong.  The      HERD MAN is weak.  The herd man represents a decline in the human       spirit.  A reversal of the desire and will to grow, to become stronger, greater, and to overcome more --                                                                                                                RE: "Society has its rules.. you must obide by them or be punished"                                                                             Take a step back and consider just what you said.  WHO will punish, and WHY will they punish?  Is it not the HERD we are speaking of here?  WE  live in a herd-man society -- a declining society.                                                                                              RE: You don't think my views are compatible with the society we             live in                                                                                                                                     You're correct.  I view the society we live in with a fair degree of    contempt.  I think it is a declining, degenerating society, and has beenfor about 2000 years now.  I think it is a society which is controlled  by the herd instinct, and is conducting an open attack on the will to   overcome things, on the desire to grow, and on the passions which make  human existance worthwhile.                                                                                                                     The society we live in, the herd man society, views itself as the only  sort.  I do not view it as the only sort.  That is an incompatibility.                                                                          Note this: My view is a CRITICISM of society.  You cannot refute my     criticism by suggesting that it doesn't agree with the criticized.

But this in no way makes me wrong.                                                                                                       RE: Allies are better than enemies.                                                                                                             Wrong.  Sometimes enemies are better than allies.  What is important is NOT that one has allies, but that one is capable of defending oneself   against ones enemies.  However -- an ENEMY is not necessarily bad or    evil.  An enemy is, by definition, at the very least an equal (else one would not worry about what he might do) -- an enemy can REPAY you:      kindness for kindness, or cruelty for cruelty.                                                                                                  On the other hand, an ally might be weak, and impotent, and only an allyout of fear.  An ally of THIS sort may NOT be able to repay you.  May   not be capable of repaying kindness for kindness or cruelty for cruelty.                                                                        Such an ally is contemptible.  Such an enemy is noble, nonetheless for  being an enemy.                                                                                                                                 Your VALUE JUDGEMENT that "allies are better than enemies" stems from   your fear of others, and the desire not to have to be afraid.  FEAR is asign of weakness.                                                                                                                               "Allies are better than enemies" is only true if you are terrified and  afraid that you not adequate to look out for yourself.                                                                                                                                                                  My revised version: Allies are SOMETIMES better than enemies.  Enemies  are SOMETIMES better than allies.  There is no absolute here.

For   those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, and those who do,   get the file (OS_2.txt). It's really worth the DL.                                                                      Drew Guckenberger       I am old fashioned, I like accoustic instrumenatation.  Mind you, I havesome sythesyser favourites --- the "chariots of fire" album comes to    mind.                                                                        With regard to paper/screen while editing, I think that a lot of   that is what you are used to.  Any more, I find printing on paper rathercumbersome.  I sledom make hard copies of things that I am writing. But then I have been writing on a screen for 20 years now.                    We spend most weekends on the water now, and the bug situation is     quite different.  A boat with decent beds, hot and cold water, a        microwave, stereo, etc. is a much more decrepit way to camp.            YES!!!!!!  The water was incredible.. forever when I think of the       Bahamas, I will dream in colours of azure, torquoise and aqua.  Both Kimand I noticed it was hard to fall asleep upon return  cause we missed   the sounds of the crashing waves and the swish of the palm fronds...    sigh.. can I go back now please?

It's not easy being a childless cuople when there's nothing but kids allaround you.  We married late in life and did so mostly for the          companionship, we therefore mutually decided that since niether of was  was all that keen on the idea of being parents, we wouldn't be.                                                                                   Anyway, whatever the reason, with no children that deletes another    large chunk of the most common topics of conversation.

I have to agree Donald.  Except for program code, which I find      easier to edit on paper, I rarely make a hardcopy of what I'm working onuntil I'm ready to hand it over to my proofreader (the wife).  Then i'llprint the submission copy only if the people I'm writting for insist on it; if I can submit it on disk or by modem I'll do so.

Lots of lies told on both sides of the issue, I shall tell a short storyabout a friend who shall remain nameless, a dabbler who dabbled for     years, never considered coke to be a dangerous drug, then one night he  decided to do a few lines before playing hockey, it should have enhancedthe experience no?  - instead as he was chasing a guy down the ice he   suddenly felt his heart palpitating and his breath growing short. He hsahas completely quit since. Over 5000 people died from the effects of    coke in NA last year. The only thing it does is make you feel omnipotentfor several minutes, the only fun is in the doing, a highly overated anddangerous habit                                                         I've heard that the BASWIZ programs are really pretty good.  Has anyone had any experience with them, and able to recommend using them with     qbasic?  If so, how easy are they to link to existing qbasic routines.  thanks/jim                                                                Well, treeplanting itself isn't much fun, it's hard work, repetitive  and boring; but everything else around it (ie camp life, weekends in    town) more than makes up for it. Oh, and the money of course, on a good day an experienced planter can make about $300 a day... And yes, there  are women too, the ratio in my camp was 12 guys to 14 women (yes, we    were actually outnumbered!), but then again the other camp from our     company (1 hour down the road) had 28 guys and 5 women....              re: Heard THAT before                                                                                                                             Probably because it's true.

Well, I'm going in a couple months - you  could always hide in my luggage! :-)  Don't get too close to the socks, though!  I think I may try to take a fish home for my aquarium - sort ofstrange, but I want to see if I can do it.  A friend of mine said his   brother brought home a large number of them, and they are really very   beautiful.

Where do I apply! :-)  Did you go through the university?      Is the work hard on your back?  I've had people tell me I shouldn't do  it because it's hard on the back, although I've never had trouble.      So, you must have some interesting stories about this trip, what with   all those women around! :-)                                             oh quit yer whining! yes i went with kelly and we had a great time! we  are both baked beyond beleif...as for telling you...i really didn't havetime to tell anyone except mum...i found out friday that i was leaving  sunday, which didn't leave me much time to do ANYTHING!                 so bub, where you been hiding, i haven't seen you in ages and i need to bug someone new!! wanna come over and compare cars?                     the only one i'd model for is my other half, SIG, and i doubt it would  be a wetsuit!                                                           you could stick with the old fella, he probably lives closer than owen! hey i would go back just to get a picture of that wet suit! get it blownup lifsize...

RE: Well if there are 100 of them, there's strength in numbers                                                                                  You're missing the point.                                                                                                                       The VALUE of life is in growth, overcoming, and so forth.  It is not    WORTHWHILE to strive for mediocrity.                                                                                                            Sure -- 100 weak people can gang up and defeat one strong person.  But  the things which MAKE people strong also make life worthwhile.                                                                                  What has happened is all these weak people have been attacking the      things which make people strong.. passions, desires, etc..                                                                                      Hence they have been attacking the things which make life worthwhile.                                                                           It is not the strong people themselves which are worthwhile, it is the  things which cause strong people to come into existence: the basic      desire to grow and overcome things..                                                                                                            To attack this is to wage war on life itself.                                                                                                                                                   Justin                  What do you I looked like I could kill...kill what??..gee did I look    that bad...???   Saturday night was pretty good...the only bad thing wasthat I wasn't drinking ..because I had offered to be designated         driver...bummer.obh well...Kathy and my cousin Dianne had a pretty good time...it was Dianne's first time...so we helped her along...we even gother a table dance...she just about died...we laughed so hard..          My brother even had a really good time...I was so amazed that we got himto go up on stage...you see it was his birthday..so we told the one girland she got him up there ...it was great...he sat on this chair and     sprayed her with water and when it came to putting his two dollars      somewhere ..he put it in her shoe...god that was so funny...            Of course  I was on my best behaviour as always...god how boring!!      Don't you think a black chev would even be better than the sidekick..?? Pretty soon I will have a better car....good things come to those who   wait...right..??...all I can say is YAH RIGHT...!!!???                  Well maybe I will wait for the movie to come out on video and invite youover instead...<wink> <wink>....I warm up your chair and everything..!! About the dead grasshopper. There are no benefits for the dead. Also    that grasshopper had little choice. It's will is the will of nature. If I choose to for what ever reason I would like the benefit of knowing    that something meaningful would result from self sacrifice. If there areany benefits for the dead, it is knowing this. Also I would have to be  certain beyond my own perception.                                       Hi, just to comment. I don't think Nietsche meant there isn't good or   evil. Also at a certain point even Nietsche is a limit.                 Well you could kill uhhhhh ???? Let's drop the conversation !  Uhhh YEP !                                                                       So, the Network was a good time !  Glad to hear !  Your bro went up on  stage eh ???  Sometimes I see myself at an estute establishment such as that and a brawl starting and poor litlle sulty getting his ass kicked  and his picture on the FRONT PAGE of the Record !  Boy, wouldn't that beswell !  Well good that you were on your best behaiviour !  Who knows   what might have happened then !                                         Black Chevy nahhhh, get a Cordoba with a leather interior !  Now, that'sa real car !  Yes, that might be better !  Do you have remote control,  like so we can pause if we get all confused ?????                       On the topic of the dead soldier. It is interesting you mention         democracy here. I assume you know of Nietzsche's fear of the democratic movement as he knew it. I see his fear being directed towards democracy as "the tyrany of the majority". Perhaps you are not as rigidly         Nietzschian as I first thought. Do you think that fear is still as      broadly valid today as yesterday? I don't think so, providing that      "herdism" is recognized as a threat.                                    I see you have been to the warmer region of the earth. Did you go to    Columbia as well, if I may stab in the dark? I am curious about South   America. Also, as long as I am asking; how about Bolivia?               You on the front page..ha..I doubt it ...maybe you would be the little  guy on the bottom of the pile of rowdys' hahahahha                      Who know what could have happened ...gee what do you mean???            AAAhh what about those Jays....damn them losers anyway...I could have   played better ball than them...but hey I was impressed with Steib ..you know he could have done a lot worst...                                  Oh yes I do have a remote control..and you know what it even has on it  is slow advance...just the those that get confused...                   Gee I was checking out the time...you actually got out of bed...see I   told you you could do it!!!  Didn't you finish with me last night..or   did you just want to savour me night and morning...????                 Hey. if i was on the front page, you'd be jealous, that's all !  I am a STUD and you just don't want anyother woman touching me !  GEEK !  Well,what could have happened is you could've been drinking and you could've lets say, found a well paying and fullfilling nite job !  YEAH RIGHT !  Well, Stieb wasn't at his best, but he'll get better !  Hey, the damn   woman at work said he was so good looking !  Who are they talking bout !Not my Dave !                                                           Good to see you got a good remote !  You know, you canm get a TEAC CD   player from places for about $110 bucks or so !  That's a good price forTEAC !!!  Yes, mom i got out of bed, didn't you notice !!  Hey, about   this finish me at night, savour me in the morning stuff !  How bout     saying this on the phone woman !                                        Justin, you seem to have a low regard for most people's capabilities. I believe that most people have the ability to better themselves. We all  strive to be better human beings. You can read the examples of people's unselfish behavior in the newspaper. Just the other day over 3,000      people searched for evidence of Kristen French's disappearance. These   people may have done it to protect themselves from a possible serial    killer but I think they responded to the pain felt by the French family.This example and others like it help to define what is good and what is bad. Examples are required to teach people. And what they teach are     moral values. People respond to these examples on a gut level. Emotionalimpact reaches far deeper than mere book-learning. People can learn how to do things from books but how people act is not subject to the perusalof mere words. People do not respond to logic and act before thinking   not after. Therefore, your reasoning does not apply to others but just  to yourself. Don't try to change people to your way of thinking just    accept them for themselves.                                                                                                                                                             Mike                            Thats right I don't want  any other woman looking at my Macho Man...I   will have to beat them away from you...it will terrible ..blood all overthe place...what a mess!!!                                              They said in the Sun that there were a bunch of guys at the Jays game   dressed up to look like Stieb...hey he isn't too shabby looking you     know.. but of course he doesn't look as good as you do ...right??!!     TEAC CD player  $110 ....where...?? sounds good to me...you know        Mother's Day is coming up really fast and this mother would love a CD   player..<hint> <hint>  I know tell Christopher and Jason...shit they    don't have any money...oh well ... c'est la vie!!                       I shy and innocent on the phone...look can't you see me blushing        now...actually..I am trying to stir things up on the bbbs...            Scene:  Young man swaggers into Dodge City saloon.  There's a man in    shirt sleeves playing the piano and Doc Holliday's sitting at a table   drinking.                                                               He goes over to Doc and says: "I'm just starting in the gunslinger biz, can you give me some tips on how to draw fast?"                         Doc: "Well, first off - tie your holster down on your leg."             He ties it down, and looks around for something to practcie on.  Spies  the piano player - draws his gun (pretty fast) and shoots the cufflink  off the pianist's left sleeve.  (Piano player doesn't even flinch, just keeps on playing).                                                      Man: "Say Doc that was great - do you have any more tips?"              Doc: "Try tying the holster down lower on your leg, just at the level ofyour relaxed hand."                                                     Man adjusts his holster, draws (really fast) and shoots the cufflink offthe pianist's right sleeve. (Piano player doesn't even look up - just   keeps on playing).                                                      Man: "Say Doc that was even better - any more tips?"                    Doc: "Did you see that barrel of grease just outside?"                  Man: "Yes - I think so."                                                Doc: "Well - I'd advise you to go out and dip your pistol barrel a few  times in the grease."                                                   Man: "Will that help my draw be quicker?"                               Doc: "I don't know about that but it will help the pain when Wyatt Earp finishs playing that piece and comes over here to shove that gun        up your ass."                                                           I've tried a friend's "turbo C" a couple of times, and am looking to buyan Ibm C enviro.  I wanted to ask who thought what was the better       compiler/editor combination.  I didn't particularly like borland's      editing keys, etc, but I was satisfied with the compiler.  Many email   messages I've read lead me to beleive microsoft C works well for them.  I feel kinda silly asking these questions, since I'm really only        conversant with programming environments for the Macintosh.                                                                                     Chris                                                                                                                                           RE: The grasshopper had no choice, its will is the will of nature                                                                               So is yours.  What's the difference?                                                                                                            Yours is the same will of nature filtered through a much more complex   mechanism.                                                                                                                                      My initial point was that all life forms express fundamentally the same desire to overcome things.  The simplest expression of this fundamental drive shows up in the amoeba -- it "wants" to consume everything, to    make itself bigger, and grow as much as possible, even if it has to     split itself in two to keep on growing.                                                                                                         This same sort of desire shows up in ALL life, including human life.    At the bottom, everything we do is motivated either from a desire to    grow stronger/better or from fear.  And fear is nothing other than the  worry that we may be prevented from growing stronger/better -- really   just two sides of the same coin.                                                                                                                Re: If there are any benefits to the dead, it is in knowing that            they have accomplished something                                                                                                            Why?  I suggest that 'knowing' is the LEAST important thing.  Knowing issomething relatively recent in human history -- self sacrifice, as I    mentioned, exists down to practically the lowest forms of life.                                                                                 What is important is the will to overcome --                                                                                                    "Knowing" is just a way of verifying our success.  A mere sophisticationadded late in the game so as to increase the chance of success, and     improve efficiency.  Once you 'know' you have succeeded in something,   you can then direct your efforts to something else -- rather than risk  giving up before completion, or wasting time on something which no      longer requires attention.                                                                                                                      Hence "knowing" is SECONDARY to the desire to grow -- it is a tool:     something which enables us to grow in strength more quickly.  NOT an endin itself.                                                                                                                                      All "knowing" can do is confirm the success, where that success itself  is the source of value, and not the knowing about the success.                                                                                  When the means to success necessarily involves death, then obviously    'knowing' is pointless, since it can have no further effect on actions  after death.                                                                                                                                                                                         Justin                                                                                     Re: Tyranny of the majority                                                                                                                     I think that fear is fairly real.  Nietzsche laid down a lot of         interesting foundations, and then quite often ignored his own           conclusions.  He did this intentionally, though, something that most    people wish -- one of his points was that no SYSTEM of philosophy can betrue since it must necessarily contain some undefended premiss.                                                                                 (Nietzsche also had a view that, from a philosophical perspective       anyway, that we should assume anything which cannot be proven is        actually false).                                                                                                                                What I'm leading up to is this: On the one hand Nietzsche despised the  democracy movement.  On the other hand he thought it was inevitable,    that it was bound to bring about the fall of civilization, and so in    order to make room for something better which would follow, it should beencouraged.                                                                                                                                     So he was not an "opponant" of democracy, but neither was he a          "supporter" -- I believe there is a passage in Beyond Good & Evil in    which he states that anyone who opposes him has failed to understand    him (because he isn't constructing a system, just making observations).                                                                                                                                                 - - - - -                                                                                                                                       To finally answer your question: Do I think that fear of the majority isvalid today, as much as it was previously --                                                                                                    Yes.  I think Nietzsche's points about ressentiment and the common man  hit the mark dead on.  It seems to me that MOST people do formulate a   lot of their defintiions of "good" and "evil" by calling "evil"         everything which results in them being "left out" -- and calling "good" all those things which result in them being "included".                                                                                         The only major point against condemning democracy on these grounds, to  my mind, is that as yet the democracies of the 19th and 20th century    have never even come close to "including" the common man -- there are   still classes of people.                                                                                                                        I would agree with Nietzsche that this is probably a good thing.  And   that it is probably a bad thing that the people who do run things have  to pretend to be public "servants" --                                                                                                                                                         Justin                                                                                            Does anyone know how I can do one of the following --                                                                                           (1) Access Telnet                                                       (2) Access my internet account at UW from Toronto without                   having to phone Waterloo                                                                                                                    For various reasons, I'd like to stay on the internet while I'm gone    from Waterloo for the summer.  Obviously I don't feel like paying long  distance calls --                                                                                                                               However if there is some relatively inexpensive way to do this, or      better yet, if it's free, I'd like to know.                                                                                                     Specifically -- can I do either of these with datapac?  If so how?      Is there any way of accessing Telnet directly?  (I do it via my account at U of W.. I'm not actually interested in using Internet, I want the   Telnet access so I can keep in touch with a server I log into           regularly).                                                                                                                                     If not.. does anyone know of any way I can purchase a Telnet account forthe summer in Toronto?  Is it mondo-expensive?  I don't need Usenet     access or anything like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Justin           Could you say then that perfection is pointless?                        On the majority fears. Now that I think of it the protection of propertyand the rule of law should keep resentful groups at a safe distance. Thelaw has to take into account that even if we are all born equal we don'tend up equal. Actually I think Churchill said that communism wants      people to stay equal. Also that democracy may not be perfect but is the best we've got. I agree there but also see that if something better can be developed we should abandon democracy. One day wealth in the form of goods and services will be so great a sum that it will lose value. We   will have to give up our poverty mentallity. It is even possible that   that mentality stands in the way of an overflow of wealth. Hopefully,   the measure of a man will not mean how much in the way of possessions   but what they are as a reflection of him.                               I guess we just have different consceptions of "roughing-it."           Personally I follow the rule "if you can't carry it for twenty miles,   then you can't take it camping."

Re: The Rule of Law..                                                                                                                           The rule of law does not keep resentful groups at a safe distance.  It  subordinates everyone by making everyone inferior to rule of law.  Henceif anything, it would serve to make everyone resentful.  It has been    DESPITE the so-called "rule of law" that we have succeeded in           maintaining a society where there are differences in rank between       people.                                                                                                                                         I would reject the claim that there is anything which should be superiorto the human spirit in and of itself.  Rather law should be a tool by   which those who wield power extend their power.  And wherever any systemof law/society attempts to resolve all differneces between peoples and  put an end to all conflicts of power -- that system has done a great    dis-service to humanity.                                                                                                                        Re: Democracy may not be perfect but it's the best there is                                                                                     This is one of those cliche things that people accept without really    giving it any consideration.                                                                                                                    On WHAT GROUNDS do you make the value judgement "it's the best there    is"?  According to what?  No -- WHOSE -- criteria do you claim this?                                                                            I think when you get to the root of it, it is the criteria of the herd  which claims democracy is the best there is -- and makes this claim     because democracy is the system which most protects the herd.                                                                                   Specifically, it does this by preventing anyone from becoming too       strong.  This is simple herd ressentiment: "If I can't be strong, then  neither can you -- nyah nyah nyah -- I may not be as strong as you, but at least I'm capable of wrecking your life too."

Whenever someone thinks that they have come as far as one can go, and   decides that they must be the ultimate -- the point past which no-one   else can go -- well haven't they really LOST the desire to grow?                                                                                To say that society is now at its peak, or that humanity no longer needsto improve, is really to admit you no longer desire to grow, to conquer and to overcome things --                                                                                                                       Quite simply it is nihilism: the view that there is nothing more of any value combined with a general loss of the will to live.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         There is ALWAYS a better/stronger thing to seek after -- in this sense  value and meaning is limitless and eternal.                                                                                                                                                                             (BTW -- Nietzsche's "Superman" -- usualy people misunderstand this, it  is meant to describe the man of the day after tommorow.. there will     never be a superman: the superman will ALWAYS be that next step).

They must allow you to be what you wish to become. Like wise, you to them. This   would be a collective agreement. I see us as a collection of            individuals. After all, the only thing we really have in common is a    similar fate. That is death.                                            Has anyone seen Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead?

You must account for some people more than for others,        and some you can account for very little.                                                                                                   (2) There are various forms of law, and various uses to which               it can be put.  RULE of law is but one -- and I have suggested          that it perhaps has a number of undesireable qualities.                                                                                     (3) To the extent to which law actually does RULE, people have              been subgugated.  I have no objection to law being used as a            means of making people account for one another, and especially          being weilded by one person/group against another to better             account for them.  But --> when NO-ONE is above the law, then           in effect the spirit of the whole human race has been broken:           everyone has been subjugated.                                                                                                                   Don't confuse this and think I mean everyone should be free:            I don't.  Rather I mean SOMEONE -- and not arbitrarily anyone           either, but someone who actually CAN be.  Generally, BTW, such          a person would be called "evil" by your herd-man society.                                                                                   (4) Law is designed to TAME people and make them UNDANGEROUS --             I quite like the idea of people being untamed and dangerous.                                                                                    I equate "tame" with "broken spirit".  When you tame an                 animal, you really break its spirit and enslave it.  Similarly          so for people.                                                                                                                                                                                                      Or, in far fewer words: "Live dangerously."

Anyone lookingto sell, contact me here or at (519)746-6757.                           I have an excess of guitar amps right now, and am considering parting   with my Yamaha Hundred-212. This is a pretty old amp, around the dawn ofpractical transisitor combo amps. This amp has enough balls to keep up  with the loudest skin bashers. Effects: Distortion, Reverb, 4 Tone, and even Tremolo (really dates it here). As it sounds from the part number, it has 100 Watts of power and 2 12 inch speakers.                       Interested parties may contact me through the BBS, or at 747-9062 (voicephone with answering machine). Asking price is $225.                                                                      Regards,                                                                Mark Church                                                             Life is a Moose.      I seldom print code eithor.  I tend to top down and debug as I go, and  seldom write more than I can remeber before testing. In the odd case    where I write four or five pages before testing, I often use a second   terminal to change code on, while debuging on the first.  I also use a  third terminal to check file results "on the fly".                      Re: carrying it 20 miles.  Tough to do over water.   I have hitchhiked  accross the country several times, and the "carry it" rule is fine if   you truly enjoy roughing it.  Personally, I enjoy comfort more.         That someone who can be free.  I take you mean the superman. I think I  see how that could work. I guess you don't agree about the              implementation of the Magna Carta.

But then I wake up,                                                     And the reality of my life pours in.                                    I look around myself,                                                   And find that I am,                                                     Alone.

Well, whatever sweet nothings are !!!  I ain't familiar with these      60-70's words !  Maybe the next time i'm over you can show me with handson examples ???                                                         Well, your outta luck woman !  I am working like every other person in  the world, but at 6:00 AM !!!  So, I don't think I can make it in !     BUT, we'll have to go out for did din soon !  I haven't since !         Show you with hands on ...gee I didn't know that you can read sign      language...hahahahah                                                    No problem sweetheart I will show you anything you want ...????         I am not outta luck darling ..so take that and stick it in your hat...  I am sure you know now that I found your list..and answered it as well  Your message doesn't make much sense ..you must be tired ...well as soonas you are ready we will definitely do the dinner thing...okay          I have dozens of programs that do that sort of thing, but without the   documentation on the specific device that you are using it is very      difficult to do much.  Most of them have an RS-232 port, and you simply pass data back and forth.  Almost the same as modem programming.        Boy, i should've been there when you got the machine working !  Shit youwould've been as happy as can be !  Shoot, i'm never there for the good times !  Well, atleast you used it, before you get your next one eh ??  Your right !  I must have been asleep when I wrote that eh???? Well,    i'll call you just as soon as i'm ready to go for din din !  Good game  by Todd S. last evening don't you think Z???                            ya know what? you wrote a message to yourself                           come on guy's.. this place is dead.. when i used to call this place (andgot kicked off from being a minor) then got access back there is        zilch,ditto,nada! nothing in this base!                                 come on guys                                                            !

What is the scoop on that.  I heard from Barb, form Jason when he phoned Jim to tell him that he hasa new job.  Oh well talk later.                                         P.S.  I am going to the Prom.  (with Wendy)                             Why to people always put that line in "I'm to sexy for my ????" it is   STUPID???  The song it self is not bad, but the line it's self is       getting monotinous.                                                     As far as what I have been able to determine, this type of device uses  something called VISA (?) protocol.  After a connection has been made   between the POS terminal and the modem, the application program has to  send out an ENQ.  The POS terminal responds with STX and ETX.  After    that, I have no idea what happens.  If any of this information rings a  bell with you and/or you have a program which works in a similar        fashion, please let me know.  At this point, ANY help is much           appreciated.  I am running into roadblocks all over the place trying to get a technical specifications manual for the POS terminal.  Must be    some industry secret, I guess.  :-)                                     Well look at this not only do I get to use it once but twice...wow aa   woman couldn't have it any better....if you are really good I will lwt  (let) you come over and see it working and everything...???             This is the first time in a long time that anything has worked in my    bedroom...you don't know how that makes me feel...??????????????        Good Game...it was GREAT...you had to see it .....bottom of the ninth   inning...scoreless game...pressure is on...bases are loaded with Pat    Tabler up to bat ...and two out if I am not mistaken....boom...Abbott   throws four count them four balls in a row...totally amazing...         yes you are absolutely correct in stating the fact that Todd            Stottlemeyer had a hell of a good game...especially against Abbott who Imust say is a pretty amazing pitcher too...let's just hope that we can  keep this winning streak up for awhile...???!!!                         Thank you for the note Greg.  I wrote that years ago when I was in high school.  I believe that I was supposed to actually be doing something   like Algebra or something, but my mind was wondering.  She was very goodlooking and very out of reach.  Oh well, live and learn.  I'll see if I can dig up any more of my stuff in my archives (a shoebox somewhere).   Later.                                                                  I decided to leave you a note seeing as there were no other messages on this base.  No.  No I haven't read anything by Gene Wolfe or however it is spelled.  Have you aver read anything by Dave Duncan?  His stuff is  fantastic!  He's written a couple of series for Del Ray that are truly  great works.  The first series is "The Seventh Sword"  which is the     first stuff that I got from him.  Your classic sword quest with a few   interesting twists.  The second series is "A Man of His Word".  This washard to read because they only came out about 1 book every 5 or 6       months.  That is the only problem about reading a current series.  Otherthan that, fantastic writing.  It's a story about a stable boy who      becomes ... nevermind.  I hate when people give away the whole book.  Ifyou want to talk books, I have about 600 novels ranging from SF to      Horror and am always interested in hearing about great new authors.  I  must admit though that I haven't been able to read as much as I like dueto time constraints from my job and social life, but every time that I  get a chance, I sleep.  Wait, that doesn't sound right.  It may not     sound right, but it's true.  Sorry for babbling.                                                                                                                                                                        Mark.                                                                   what's new with us? we are moving! i know how happy you are to hear     that! it's only to heslper, i know not far enough, maybe next time we   will move right out of province! then what would you do??? as for       babies, nothing yet...                                                  you had to be on holidays in the bahamas to really appreciate the       phrase, annoying as it is, it suited!                                   and i AM too sexy...

Hespeler is the center of the universe.  I think you will really enjoyour downtown area, we have two, count 'em, two sports card shops. [god  knows why].   If u r into fishing, someone did spot *A* fish in the     speed river a few years back.                                                                                                                     One thing too look forward too ... u can call guelph, kitchener,      preston etc etc, no LD, so Hespeler is the best place in the world to   bbs from.                                                                                                                                         Where abouts r u moving??                                             I have been to Bavaria a few times when I was young. My uncle, aunt and grandmother live there. The mountains are the best. While there I       visited Austria for a day. The other places in Germany that I visited   were Frankfurt and the outlying area's. How was Amsterdam for you?      I am looking for a definition or a title perhaps;the title would        describe someone with a deep appreciation of the grotesque. Does anyone have any suggestions to give?                                           Well, Moving to hespeler doesn't count !  Hespeler, you might as well   move to L.A. !  There ain't no difference !                                                                                                     Re: That someone should be free -- you take it I mean the superman                                                                              No.  Because Nietzsche meant something very specific by that term and inthis case it does not be apply.  It would be an abuse of the term to    apply it here, and the term has already been abused badly enough as it  is.                                                                                                                                             I should like to speak to this point --                                                                                                         My reading of Nietzsche is that the superman is not an end or a given   state of man.  The superman is not any one person, or sort of person, ortype of person.  It is an abstract concept which really doesn't have a  concrete representation in the real world.  Specifically it is the      concievable future sort of man who has become in some way higher -- and this statement is true at all times.  So when/if this conceivable futuresort of man actually came to exist, at THAT point they would not be the superman, because a better and higher potential would have been created.                                                                        Something which has gone largely unnoticed in English philosophy is the fact that "superman" is a horrible translation of the term "Ubermensch" and actually a more proper translation would be "supraman".  The        important difference being that "superman" or "overman" imply that beinga ruler is the defining trait, whereas supraman implies that being a    higher sort is the defining trait (and in Nietzsche's view ruling       FOLLOWS from this, as a secondary thing).                                                                                                       So I hope you see why I object to calling the superman that "someone":  the superman will NEVER actually exist -- whenever any sort of man      exists one can conceive of a stronger sort which does not yet exist, andthis stronger man, who does not yet exist, is the superman.                                                                                     What is more important is that the fundamental drive of life be given   expression -- and to the extent which the Magna Carta is opposed to     this, it is a bad idea.

Let's hope they don't      become masters of nothing.                                              The title. I wonder what sultan has to say about that?

Later,                                                                       Dude!                                               Can anyone help me locate relatively recent versions of the source code to the games MORIA, HACK, or LARN?  I'm interested in seeing how these  games do certain things, especially how the mazes are randomly designed.I have the source code to an older version of HACK (3.X), but I don't   really trust it, because it won't compile properly (at least, it is fullof "errors", and if these are fixed, the executable locks up!).                                                                                 I would also appreciate it if I could find a copy of the working        versions of LARN and HACK (I already have MORIA 5.2 running).                                                                                   Thanks for any help.                                                                                                                            Andy Stedman                                                            Sorry, but as I said, without tech specs, there is no way.  Why         don't you just get in touch with the maunfacturer?                      After a number of attempts at contacting different places, I was finallyable to place an order for a programming manual to one of the credit    card readers I mentioned.  It seems that the manufacturers are reluctantto part with this information for some reason.  It was a very           frustrating experience.  If/when I get the manual and I actually have   some difficulties, I'll get in touch with you.  Thanks for trying to    help me out.  I realize it was difficult for you with no other specs    than what I provided (which was essentially nothing in the first place).i know what you were referring to my son, i was just winding you up!    geez lighten up...have a bun!                                           well the house we are moving to is NICE and i don't have any intention  of shopping on queen street, i will come to YOUR HOUSE!!!  of course if i had my choice i would move west...                                    sorry bub, but it was just too good an opportunity to pass up! as for   being dead? well you have to get past chris!! (good luck)               sultan didn't have much to say...which for him is unusual! he knows i amonly kidding and i love him to death!!                                  All in good fun!!                                                       Now why on earth would you wanna move out west !  I know if your        thinking of vancouver, then go for it !

Here is a question for you who do you think the Jays will move on their roster to make room for Derek Bell? I posted the same question to Sultanlet's see if you both come out with the same answer and if not who will have the right answer.                                                  Bye for now.                                                            Go Jays Go!!!!                                                          re: Jays.                                                                                                                                       Not only are the Jays going to get into the World Series, they are goingto kick some royal butt in the process.                                 TTYL                                                                    I thought I knew what PMS meant until someone told me that it was short form for Putting up with Mens Shit!!!!!!                                This is for all those blondes that have had to put up with jokes from   that rest of us that have darker hair.......   What is the difference   between a brunette and a garbage can?      Even the garbage can gets    taken out once a week.                                                  My father used to tell me that when I get older I wouldn't have sex as  often.   Well I'm married and it has been so long for me I forget who   gets tied up.                                                           Well I play ball for BC Pub here in Cambridge.  They gave us $500 bucks for sponsorship and NOW expect us to win !  Shheeeeeessssh !  About     sounding bitchy !  I love it when you talk to me like that !

Problem --                                                                                                           I am not calling TO toronto, I am calling FROM toronto..                                                                                        So to connect with ANNEX I have to call LD anyway.  So it isn't worth it(but that's a great thing when you're in W'loo! -- Telnet access at 25  cents an hour!)                                                                                                                                 I was using that ANNEX thing too before it went unfree, with the GUEST  login.  Was using it to telnet down to New Mexico to play Go.. that was great.                                                                                                                                          My problem is finding internet/telnet access while I am away over the   summer.  When I'm in W'loo it's no problem --                                                                                                   I tried finding out about Datapac, which it is possible to get through  UW, but I just kept getting this twit telling me "Talk to your          departmental administrator about a network user account" --                                                                                     My "departmental administrator" doesn't have a clue what one is.  (ie:  my advisors, and they don't know anything about it, and don't want to   know anything about it because they're busy at the moment with the new  term just starting).                                                                                                                            The problem is they figure undergrads. don't do this sort or thing --                                                                           I'm even willing to pay for it (providing it isn't mega-bucks, but I    figure $30 a month would be fine, or thereabouts).  But the stupid      administrative people don't know what form I should fill out, and that  kills it right there.                                                                                                                           So now I'm going to try and see if UofT/Ryerson/York have some service  like ANNEX and see if I can get access through it.. but I'm not very    hopeful because I'm not a student in any of those places.  My only hope is that they will give me one because I am a student somewhere else.                                                                            (or sell me one.. I can afford 25 cents an hour.  I can even afford $1  an hour which is what a UNIX account runs if you buy it).                                                                                                                                         Justin                                                                                        Re: let's hope they don't become masters of nothing                                                                                             I fear that that trivializes my point.  The worth and value isn't in    controlling something.. the worth and value is in the growing/overcomingwhich leads to such: the will and the desire to overcome things is what is important, not having previously overcome them.                                                                                              I can imagine some very powerful person who has overcome all obstacles, succeeded in all tasks, sitting around looking at the world.  Such a    person might feel that everything has been accomplished.  Such a person might think that all that is necessary is to hold on to what has been   acquired.  Such a person might well believe themselves to be the        pinnacle.  The will of such a person might influence everyone that      lives, perhaps they have become master over all.                                                                                                Such a person might feel there is no need to overcome anything, no need to grow any more.                                                                                                                               Such a person would be the most contemptible, most low, most base, most worthless person ever to have existed.                                                                                                          On the other hand -- someone with nothing, someone with no existing     power, no control over anything... but the will and the desire to grow  in every instant, who will take great risks to improve, grow, overcome  and become victorious.. such a person really makes the whole human race worthwhile (literally).                                                                                                                                                                           Justin                                                                                        You're moving to Queen East?  As in Toronto?  If so.. see you there.. I live in Toronto now.  My computer and modem will live there too,        hopefully by this weekend.                                                                                                                      So.. goodbye to all for a few months.. I will return in September.. and probably drop in a times now and then to see what mail I may have       accumulated..                                                                                                                                   Have a happy summer...                                                                                                                                                                   Justin                                                                                                 How about 'Lord of the Flies' or some such thing?                                                                                               Or did you mean by title just the 'lord' part, and not the 'of the X'   part?                                                                                                                                           If so.. call up a fire'n'brimstone church and ask them what various     titles it is proper to refer to Satan as.  I'm sure they've thought up afew good ones.                                                                                                                                  (The Baptists are a good fire'n'brimstone church.. at least it seem so  from the signs they always have out front).

How about "Ugly bag of mostly water" -- ???  You can thank Star Trek forthat one.                                                                                                                                                                                                Justin         if i did go back west i wouldn't live in vancouver, it's a lot like     toronto! i would go into the interior of bc, it's much nicer!  oh but i couldn't leave you behind! i know, i will take you with me, you should  fit in my suitcase! there's a plan!!!                                   cheap shots are the only ones i give you! you don't expect me to waste  MONEY on YOU?! come on now!! send her my regards, hope she is feeling   better, maybe we should send george the animal to see her!!             You could say one's actions determine the individual. How others would  interpret them would be only seen as their opinion by the individual,   not feedback to be input into futher determination of what the next     action would be.                                                        Lord part...                                                            I'll have to bounce that off a friend who is a baptist. Could be worth  listen to, even though I don't think she is a serious baptist. "Lord of the flies" is good though. I prefer my devils to be more whimsical. Theyare in a way a good role model for individuals.                         Why, it is as plain as the nose on our ugly primate faces. Though I may have jumped to conclusions on "Misanthropod". To appreciate the         grotesque doesn't need to mean disgust. From personal experience, I can think of someone I know who seems to be this way. Perhaps even evil     hapiness a state of mind that is not talked of, so Nietzsche put it.    Ok, I won't even ask!!!]                                                Alright, It's nice to know that you are still on the good side!!]       talk later                                                              TTly                                                                    Well, it should go easier with a manual.  Good luck.                    I received my programming manual for one of the credit card readers.    While it does provide some of the details about the actual piece of     hardware that I'm dealing with, it does not tell me ANYTHING about VISA protocol (i.e. the "industry standard" protocol for these devices).  I  am now trying to find out exactly how VISA protocol actually works.  AllI've been getting for my efforts so far is a bunch of strange looks (as in "I don't have a clue what you're talking about.").  If you can point me in the right direction where to find this information, I would       appreciate it very much.  I have contacted VISA (the credit card people)thinking that VISA protocol has something to do with VISA credit cards  but with no success.  What will probably turn out to be a trivial       exercise in programming is really causing me some grief right now.       Hey out there, This message is  Tres IMPORTANT!!!!!!                     I found out, after speaking with a guy at Radio Shack, that ADLIB wentunder on Friday morning. I hopethis doesn't put to many of you with     there sound cards down, but I'd get all the software I can from System  EX-10 before it's all gone.                                             I suggest a new and more lively topic for discussion on this base.      Mother's day has inspired me to air my ideas on the abortion issue. I amfor choice, but with an added feature. What happen's to the fetus after it has been remved from the patient? If it is merely disosed of , then  what a waste. I suggest that the medical establishment coulndn't find a better model to cunduct scientific experiments; for the cure of dread   diseases and the like. This could be far more accurate then using       animals or other methods. This would end a major greivence of the animalrights advocates.I'm not clear about what month a fetus forms a nervous system, so this may not be feasable. A female could be counseled to keepthe pregnancy to the last possible stage to give a more usable subject; unless ofcourse the female is at risk. Does anyone have any comments on this idea? Pherhaps it's already being done and this suggestion isn't   original. However, discussion would still be interesting . Also, is it  possible that fetus parts could be grown to provide transplant organs? Ifeel we shouldn't be shocked by this as I think we must make the most ofthe present situation.  There will continue to be unwanted pregnancy forthe forseeable future. I'm convinced Sinead O'conner will provide us    with some more.                                                         Ralph.                                                                  I see that you have a friend that is a Baptist.  I live in Waterloo and the Baptist are becoming so liberal here that they are saying hello to  each other in the liquor store.                                                                                                                 Did you know that Brian Mulroney really is a nice guy?  He just played  to much football with his helmet off.                                   In a grade three class in one of the Waterloo County school a young     fellow about eight years old put up his hand and when the teacher asked him what he wanted he said "can I go for a piss"?  Well the teacher     started giving him a lecture about that kind of language not being      acceptable language to use.  He would have to come up with a better way to ask about going to the wash room, like use a more acceptable word    like urinate, and if he could use urinate in a sentence he could go to  the washroom.  After sitting there thinking for a few minutes and havingto go to the wash room really bad the little fellow finally put up his  hand again.  When the teacher asked him what he wanted he replied       "teacher urinate and if you had bigger tits you would be a ten, now can I go for a piss"?                                                                                                                               RE: actions determine the individual                                                                                                            I think this is self evident.  Action determines everything.  Everythingis an action or a process of some sort.  There is no such thing as      something which exists without doing something.                                                                                                 I'm not sure I'm clear with what you mean by "determine" --                                                                                     Do you mean: determine the WORTH of?                                                                                                            I don't think I agree with that.                                                                                                                Your actions do not determine your value.  Someone who *evaluates*      determines your value (it may be you, it may be someone else, but in anycase it is someone).  The evaluator may choose as their criteria some   scheme based on actions, or they may take something else as their       criteria, or even just be completely arbitrary.                                                                                                 Value itself is a human creation.  All value is the product of human    evaluation.                                                                                                                                     Value does not originate with something outside of the human will, such as history.  (ie: past action).                                                                                                                                                                                         On the other hand you might have been speaking more psychologically whenyou said action determines people.                                                                                                              I might be inclined to agree with you that an individuals disposition,  characteristics, et. al., are the product of all the actions that went  into creating that individual at this particular moment (including      conception, socialization, and everything else).                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Justin                                                                                     You would move into the interior?                                                                                                               What an awful thought!  I don't think I could stomach seeing all those  amputees on a regular basis.  It's bad enough seeing the occasional one limping around downtown Vancouver --                                                                                                            I can just imagine what a place like Salmon Arm must be like!           The cripple capital of Canada!                                                                                                                                                                  Justin                  i can't say that i ran into any amputees that i recall, and so what?    they have just as much right to be there as i do! and i didn't really   mean salmon arm, more like penticton, vernon, kelowna...                (Chuckle,chuckle). I wouldn't call them hypocritical because I don't    think they know what to pretend to believe.                             Action determines the individual. I should of said action as the result of reason determines both the evidence of being an individual and the   method of placing value on the individual. I agree                      that value is a human developement. I have suggested what that value    should be put on. I don't consider action without reason to be somethingan individual does. The actions of L.A. rioters are not the actions of  reasonable individuals; rather I think they have completely lost any    claim to be being individuals. They must still be held accountable all  the same.                                                               I was curious to know if someone could do some explaining on the above  topic.  I am implementing a task switcher and need to know some small   details.  First of all, I am using BC ++ (C code is fine) on DOS.       What I am wondering is the basics that occurs with recording things likethe SS, SP CS, IP, and other registers and then when a task switch      occurs loading the new ones back.                                       I would prefer only C, using interrupt routines should you need them in examples...if you must, though I would dispise it, use Assembly.        I cannot offer much help beyond what I would do in the same             circumstances:  I would get on the phone and talk directly to the       manufacturors of the equipment.  There has to be someone at the "head   office" that knows what you are looking for.  The sales department for  the equipment can probably steer you in the right direction.                                                                                    Re: Amputees                                                                                                                                    I mean all those loggers (13% of all loggers) who got in the way of     something that they should have liked to stay away from --                                                                                                                                        Justin                                                                                        Re: You don't consider action without reason to be something                that an individual does                                                                                                                                                                                             Actually... although we have been agreeing for the most part up until   now, with differences only really in definitions of things... I think wemay have a big disagreement now.                                                                                                                I consider actions that an individual does because of REASON to be all  but worthless.                                                                                                                                  REASON itself is a tool of something else.  You and I are reasonable    because it in some way makes us stronger.  However... if in some        situation it made us weaker, then really it would be valueless to be    reasonable.                                                                                                                                     I suggest that this event occurs quite often.  More often than not      probably.  If we went about being reasonable all the time, we would     never accomplish anything.  If we set out to determine all our beliefs  and values based on reason, we would actually defeat the whole purpose  of HAVING beliefs and values.                                                                                                                   (I can't resist a bit of hyperbole here...)                                                                                                     REASONING --                                                                                                                                    Beliefs and values are set up because they lead us toward something:    they make us stronger.  Someone believes that X is good or evil because that belief will make them stronger and not weaker... or else they have adopted someone elses beliefs, and that was someone elses reason for    believing it...                                                                                                                                 This desire to overcome things occurs at a most basic level -- it is    probably present in an amoeba, and no one would argue that an amoeba    "reasons".                                                                                                                                      Since all beliefs, all values, etc., all stem from this desire to       overcome things, they are essentially derived from something which      CANNOT BE reason (since it is so basic).                                                                                                                                                                                WHY REASON --                                                                                                                                   Reason is a useful tool.  Once we have set out a few ground rules in themanner described above, reason turns out to be very useful in deriving  other rules which must necessarily follow -- which are really the same  thing said another way.  And reason enables us to work out intricate    little plans to put our rules into effect, and to strive toward         accomplishing what they command.                                                                                                                                                                                        The important thing is: Reason FOLLOWS from something else.. all the    most fundamental actions, which justify existence, precede reason.      Reason is a tool which these anterior things can employ.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Justin                                                                                        Someone here (I forget again who!) was looking for routines which would calculate a determinant and such things?                                                                                                        Well... I wrote some routines, one of which will do that as a side      effect.  I uploaded all this as a file called MATRIX.ZIP in the         programming area here.                                                                                                                          Among other things are the foundations of some routines which would use polynomial interpolation to search for, and locate records in a large   database with ONE DISK ACCESS... under good conditions and with some    fine tuning.                                                                                                                                    The basic contents: gaussian elimination, matrix addition and           multiplication, polynomial interpolation, polynomial evaluation.                                                                                                                              Justin                                                                                            ps -- all written in Turbo C, by the way, but in a fairly                     "generic" C, should be easy to use under MSC, et. al.             i see...well when i was up north that's all there were...loggers...and ididn't meet any amputees! i guess they were just more careful than the  ones you encountered?                                                   It would be unreasonable to act out of reason or rather ration 100% of  the time. I think it is when you don't reason that you are gambling thatcheat yourself. I am inclined to think that good and evil are two sides of the same coin.                                                       Hey guys.  Well i posted messages on all the bbs telling them that      Volcano BBS was a 2 GIG BBS.  Well in the last  week have added another GIG online.  We now have the biggest selection of BMP's that can be     viewed with your VPIC.  We also a very big selection on GIFS.  And thereis an extra line available for the people that are interested.  Anyways call volcano bbs at 746-0613...                                                                                                                 Also if you need any price at all on computers or software.  Gimmie a   call at Fast Components at 746-8014.  And ask for me Yves. I will be    glad to talk to you.  Call us first for the best prices.  We will ty andbeat or match any prices out there.                                                                                                                                                                                     Yves Sylvestre                                                          This was heard over the PA system at Toronto International Airport.     The British Airways flight for London, England, leaves gate 7 at 1200   hours,  the Lufthansa flight for Berlin leaves gate 9 at 1400 hours and the Air Canada flight for St. John's Newfoundland leaves when the littlehand is on the 4 and the big hand is on the 12.                         .                                                                       98% of Newfoundlanders in Toronto are looking forward to Quebec         seperating from Canada...then it will take them half the travel time    to visit their families back home.                                      Does this board have a method to download messages that I can't see?    Something like Bluewave?                                                There IS a specific term or tag for those who have a deep appreciation  for the grotesque, but darned if I can recall what it is.  I will dig   thru some psyche tomes and find it.                                     Seems to me, the tag was pretty grotesque, too, if I recall correctly.  You'll be pleased to know (if for no other reason than I won't bother   you about THIS topic again for a while) that I managed to get           information from a couple of people about how VISA protocol works.  As  it turned out, it's really quite simple and I have been able to write a rather rudimentary program which accepts the incoming data packet and   responds accordingly.  The next several hundred lines of code will deal with error checking.  :-)  Thanks again for your assistance.            Where's the sysop?  I've paged him and nothing happened! I wrote him andhe hassen't written back!! Where is HE!!?!?!?!?!?!                      GAry                                                                    The Term. Alllrright! The psychemeister has term for me. The            psychomatic, the psychorama! I can't Waaait.                            Doesn't anyone here in this base listen to metal tunage?                What about those who go to Hell?  Do they have to beat themselves silly? ->   we refer to you as the awesome devo or something like that         -> ???..as a   matter of fact I am listening to the game  (Jays that    -> is ) as I talk to   you ..right now they are winning 3 to 2 and      -> they are I think bottom of   the third...go it is 11:00 pm I         -> should be in bed but for some odd reason                                                                                                    Cito Gaston is a stupid fellow.  He made the Jays lose 4 in a row!      Yesterday, after losing the no-hitter and the shut-out, Cito still left the amazing Jack Morris in the ball game!  It was the bottom of the     ninth for crying out loud.                                                                                                                      Everytime the camera shows Cito, he is either sitting on his hands or   chewing his gums.  Stupid fellow.

You got me so curious!  Can you tell me how VISA protocol works?

Thanks.                                                                 I've been asking this same question every few months as I feel the urge to do so, with an added twist this time:                                                                                                        TWIST:  Can anyone help me locate the executable versions of PC-HACK or LARN, the text-graphics adventure games based loosely upon D & D?  I    would really appreciate it if someone could point me in the right       direction or upload either (or both!) of these.  They're for a good     friend.                                                                                                                                         STANDARD, TRADITIONAL QUESTION:  Can anyone help me locate the source   code to any of PC-HACK, LARN, or MORIA?  Recent versions are preferable,but any version would be of enormous help.  I'm dabbling with the idea  of writing a game that is similar in many ways, and I would like to viewthe games' maze-creating routines especially.

I see you logged in OK. Haven't done any thing with the 80286  yet. The faster one is in my machine. I can't tell if it having a       performance boost, but I don't have any good benchmark tests. I haven't done any thing with the 8051s yet either, oyher then looking for fast   ADCs and DACs. Say hi to the girlfriend.                                                                         Ralph.                         I was refering more to metal like Slayer and Judas Priest, but Metallicais cool too.                                                            yeah, yeah, yeah, there IS a term, I just can't get it, darn it.  But I persevere.                                                              I have the source code to the MS-DOS version of HACK.  You still lookingfor it??  Since my brother is using my modem for his bbs, and i hafta   call at 1200 baud, I'm not gonna upload it.  I'll place it on my        brother's system and you can pick it up there.  (online validator, so nowaiting...)  The system is Hacker's Haven, 2400 baud, 744-7520, 24hrs.  I'll be dropping by there today to bring my brother's CD's back so I'll put it on the system then for ya.                                       Sorry, don't have the EXE's anymore for moria and hack, but I gave them to another friend (not a bbs'er) so I'll ask him if he still has them.  hey you!                                                                we are starting at the ungodly hour of 9:30 am! kelly won't drive the   van so it looks as if the newfie will be picking it up...               let me know if that isn't convenient.                                    Metal?  Yepper, right here...actually I don't really listen to a lot ofthe mainstream stuff, but am really into Christian metal... now don't   get the wrong idea, it isn't 'watered down' or anything, it rocks!  I    am really into a lot of it.  The Christina music industry is kind of anunderground type industry because the majority of the stuff only gets   distributed through Christian outlets (i.e. - bookstores/music stores)  but recently SOny Music has hooked up with a major Christian distributorso more is being available to others who usually have not heard of any. For example, the recent M.E.A.T mag, had an article on Petra.  Although it is not totally metal, they do have some kickin' tunes on their newestalbum (which is avialable BTW at your local A&A, HMV etc).  But bands   like GUardian, Holy Soldier, Magdallan, Shout, Whitecross (wicked       guitarist!) TOurniquet etc are pretty good (can't get alot into         Tourniquet though but a lot of people seem to like it).  Speed metal is in there too, MTV has been playing quite a lot of Deliverance (spped    metal band (Christian)) lately etc.  The CHristian music industry has   every style of music the mainstream does.  Now I'm not trying to sell   anything to you, but like you, I love loud guitars, poudning drums,     something with a lot of energy!  There are tons of great bands out thereyou probabbly have never heard...and kick!                                                                                                              Take it easy!                                                                   Mark                                                    Sorry it took so long to get back to you, but constraints of work, work,sleep, work, and more work.....                                         I have heard of the Seventh Sword but never read it. Glad to hear that  you read a range of stuff. Back in the good old days of undergrad I tooka couple of English courses in Fantasy and SCiFi literature. Good      Stuff!! The prof selected a range of books and short stories to cover   a range in the genera. Probably the best SCIFI was Neuromancer by W.    Gibson. Really cool "cyber-punk". Have you read any of this type of     story? Future anti-utopian computer technology gone mad and could you   recommend some to me? Of the Fantasy the best was a collection of sort  stories called SanDiego Lightfoot Sue by someone whose name escapes me  right now and Mythago Wood by R. Holdstock. Well worth reading!         Unfortunatly the only fiction Ive had time to read lately has been      Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology, Critical Reviews of          Immunology, Research in Immunology and occasionally Nature, New         Scientist, and Science. They may be imaginative in their own way but    they really lack plot developement.                                     CHEERS                                                                  Greg                                                                    I have a 9600 baud v32bis v42, Mnp 5 Access series 3242 that I will sellfor 300.  If you are interested call me at 656-3392.  I expect this to  go real fast, so if you want it call soon.  (BTW -- that is a gandalf   modem, and built like a mack truck ... Canadian made as well).          With the amount of mail this board receives each day, it would certainlybe handy if you have a off-line mail door so that people can download   their messages and upload their replies.

Oh yeah, a couple of years back, there were a bunch of books put out    under Isaac Asimov presents that were showcasing new writers.  Some of  that stuff was fantastic!  I still remember one of my first books that Iever read in my pre-adult to adult life.  Nor Crystal Tears by Alan DeanFoster.  It's what started me reading SF.  Up 'til then I was reading   spy novels and that sort of stuff.  In fact, I couldn't pick up a John  D. McDonald book now if you paid me I read so much of it.  Too similar. Different book, different title......same story.  Have you read any of  the thieves' world series?  The first 5 or so were pretty good but they deteriorated from there.  It's a series that brings together different  authors that write stories on the same subject matter.  You went/go to  university?  Lucky you.  I always wanted to go back to school but just  couldn't dig myself out of this financial hole I put  myself in.        I've found that over the years, that the consistantly best written bookshave been published by DEL REY.  Of the few hundred books I have, I've  only found about 2 dogs that are DR books.  ACE is a pretty good        publisher too.  Speaking of ACE, have you ever read any Charles de Lint?He's a fantastic Canadian author.  Well, I gotta go.  Later.            Have you seen the computers at KPL?  They have one for books in print   that can track down books from titles, names, publishers, ISBN numbers, the whole shooting match.  I was talking to one of the folks there and  she said that their modem is going to be back online in September.  But unfortunately, she said that the books in print won't be part of the    selection.  Too bad.  I'd really like to find the phone number to a     computer like that.

Lots of legless loggers begging for booze money.                                                                                                                                                Justin                                                                                          I am inclined to think that good and evil are two sides of the same coinalso.. but I am also inclined to wonder just how much that coin is      actually worth, and quite willing to trade the coin for something I     value more.                                                                                                                                     Reason is a useful tool... once you have decided what is valuable, you  can use reason to improve your chances of getting it.                                                                                           But when you lose sight of the fact that that is ALL reason is, and thatit can never *determine* value, then you are in big trouble.                                                                                                                                                            The best you can do with reason is "A is like B, and I already know B isvaluable, therefore A is probably valuable too."                                                                                                BUT.. this is very weak ("probably"), subject to change (is B still     valuable?  Is it a constant value?), and although useful, is in no way  absolute.                                                                                                                                       And more importantly, the value of B must already be known.  Here we    have the fundamental problem of all systems of philosophy -- if they    deal with "value" they MUST presume some B, a priori, or else they have committed some blunder of logic somewhere.                                                                                                      This is not to say all systems of philosophy are useless.. just that    they all necessarily make assumptions of value.  Whether you are        inclined to agree or disagree with those assumptions depends on your    society and what age you live in (among other things).                                                                                                                                                                  HENCE.. if your actions are ultimately founded on reason, and nothing   else, then either your logic is wrong, or your actions are founded on   something worthless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Justin             About value.                                                            I think the meaning of your message  as I see it is that value is a     subjective thing. Simply, no two people can but the same value on       something or use the same methods to make that value. I'm not so certainthat the coin of good and evil is so worthless. Could it not be my good and my evil? Or could it not merely be the token with which I ride the  public transit? I don't believe in an absolute good or an absolute evil.I'm not clear if they are aposed or complimentary. I find the words of  Mephistopheles "Part of that force which would Do ever evil, and does   ever good.", worth mentioning. That still doesn't clear up what good andwhat evil. Reason is a tool and so is logic. If you'll excuse me, I     think good and evil to a desireable romantic thing.                     Well hello there fellow Jays fan...so sorry I haven't replied back ..butI have been having some difficulties with my computer /modem..but now I am back...glad to see there are some other people awake out there in bbsland...Sultan and I were beginning to wonder what was happening with    everyone...  You are correct about me being the Vice President of the   Steib Fan Club...and I what you can call a new loyal follower ( of      course I had a little help from my dear friend Sulty)..                 Now to answer your question regarding who they will move off the roster for Derek Bell...all I can say is god only knows what the hell they are doing some days if you know what I mean...I actually think that the yarewasting their time with him..but who knows...after the game on Thursday (my mistake  it was Wednesay May 27) it almost makes me ashamed to be a Jays fan...

You know Jay I have to agree with you there..Cito is an idiot ..god onlyknow what the hell he is doing half the time...did you see Wednesdays   game(May 27)..god I was getting so bloody mad...here we had chances to  pull ahead and who is sitting on the bench but Winfield ..and who is    going up to bat for the fifth time ..Ducey...0 for 4 and strikes out    again ...dumb move if you ask me...they better get it together soon     before they really lose it...                                           I read the book section in Saturday's Record. There is a book on        Nietzsche's sister's distortions of his writing. You may already know ofit, but just in case It is by Ben Macintyre and titled "Forgotten       Fatherland: The Search For Elisabeth Nietzsche. It's also $34.99.       question:                                                                                                                                       If a lumberjack falls in the forest, does he make a noise?                                                                                                                                                              Alex                                                                    ->   You know Jay I have to agree with you there..Cito is an idiot      -> ..god only   know what the hell he is doing half the time...did you  -> see Wednesdays   game(May 27)..god I was getting so bloody           -> mad...here we had chances to   pull ahead and who is sitting on the  -> bench but Winfield ..and who is   going up to bat for the fifth      -> time ..Ducey...0 for 4 and strikes out   again ...dumb move if you   -> ask me...they better get it together soon   before they really lose  -> it...                                                                                                                                        Dianne, I must agree with you again.  It was totally frustrating        to watch the game.  I ended up not watching it when Cito made           his non-move again.  The Jays are no longer interesting for me,         I don't want to watch Olerud strikes out, or Gruber hurts his thumb,    or Borders sacrifies a bunt into a DOUBLE PLAY!                                                                                                 But there are some good things to watch.  For example, Manuel Lee is    totally amazing this year.  Only 1 error defensively.  And offensively, he's hitting close to .260 and has 3 homeruns!  Let's all vote him into the all star game!  He must be the most improved player on the Jays     team.  While guys like Gruber and Olerud and Derek Bell are playing     worse than my 12-year old cousin!                                       Gotta agree with you again...Manny has been playing amazing this        year..but I got to be honest and tell you that my most favorite Jay is  Alomar..I think he is the best ... did you see that amazing play he madeon Saturday..now there is a guy who takes his baseball seriously... I   must admit that the Jays surprised me by sweeping the White             Sox...especially Sunday..I didn't think they were going to pull it off  then good old Winfield jumps in there with a home run in the bottom of  the ninth..right on!!  Now if they can just keep this up..lets cross ourfingers and hope for the best...                                        A little bit of History about Waimea Canyon... Waimea Canyon is located on the island if Kauai in the state of Hawaii. It is known as the Grand Canyon of the Pacific.                                                  The Riddle....................................                          Does anyone know how Waimea Canyon got its name?                        The Answer....................................                          Many years ago, explorers searched the 4000 foot canyon for Gold. They  exclaimed in agony as they were decending a cliff by rope...Why-A Me-A. ->   Gotta agree with you again...Manny has been playing amazing this   ->   year..but I got to be honest and tell you that my most favorite    -> Jay is   Alomar..I think he is the best ... did you see that         -> amazing play he made   on Saturday..now there is a guy who takes     -> his baseball seriously...

I have just recently enteredinto this fine BBS and after reading all the fine words here, I decided that I might share a little something that has had some meaning in my   life...  Hope you like it..

The dancer slows her frantic pace                                       In pain and desperation.                                                Her aching limbs and downcast face                                      Aglow with perspiration.                                                                                                                        Stiff as wire, her lungs on fire,                                       With just the briefest pause --                                         Then flooding through her memory,                                       The echoes of old applause.                                                                                                                     She limps across the floor                                              And closes the bedroom door...                                                                                                                  The writer stares with glassy eyes --                                   Defies the empty page.                                                  His beard is white, his face is line                                    And streked with tears of rage.                                                                                                                 Thirty years ago, how the words would flow                              With passion and percision                                              But now his mind is dark and dulled                                     By sickness and indecision.                                                                                                                     And he stares out the kitchen door                                      Where the sun will rise no more...                                                                                                              Some are born to move the world --                                      To live their fantasies                                                 But most of us just dream about                                         The things we'd like to be                                                                                                                      Sadder still to watch it die                                            Than never to have known it                                             For you -- the bline who once could see                                 The bell tolls for thee...

This I can identify with. I wouldn't do anything unless their           relationship is getting in trouble and is doomed to fail. Other wise    consider the consequences and if you can accept them.                                      Ralph.                                               Anyone done any joystick programming? If you have how did you do it? Didyou use int15 BIOS call? I am hacking up some routines with it and have some knots in insuring I am getting the correct value of the stick portsback.                                                                                                           Ralph.                          Well hello there little girl ! Hmmm wants some candy !  hahahaha        Anyways, our ball team " BC WARRIORS" are an awesome team !  Tonite I   think were gonna demolish our opponents !  Well, maybe i'll hit a       groundball for ya or strike out !  Me grow up !  HAHAHAHSA, nice try butnotice, i only act mature around you !`  Hmmm, that might end this      weekend ????? Now your the one wondering ?????  Anyways tell me what's  the diff between 10-111 !  Pleeeeez, i'll do anything !  YES anything ! Would any of you 'C' buffs know how to read text off the screen? I've   been trying to figure this out for awhile and haven't found it          anywhere...                                                                                                                                     What I'm trying to do exactly is:                                               1. Read a region of text from the screen and store it.                  2. Print something into that region (I know how to do this part            :-).                                                                 3. Restore the text that I previously read from the screen (I              can do this too...)                                                                                                                  An explanation would be sufficient, but a bit of understandable 'C' codewould be better.                                                                                                                                Thanks. (BTW, I will need this as soon as possible).                    ->   This I can identify with. I wouldn't do anything unless their      ->   relationship is getting in trouble and is doomed to fail. Other    -> wise   consider the consequences and if you can accept them.                                                                                 Glad you can identify with my situation.  It's really tough on me.  I   have been thinking about her day and night!                             I had exactly the same thing happen to me two summers ago - a girl who  worked at the theatre I did followed me out after a show one night.  As is the custom following a performance, we went across the street to the town bar (small town summer theatre) and had a drink.  I dumbly ignored all the 'interested' signals she was sending.  It didn't occur to me fora couple of days what had happened.  Luckily for me, she didn't give up - we've been married for a year now.  Even stupidity can be overcome    with perserverance and dedication.                                      Marc                                                                    To read off the screen, you simple need to know the address for the     location of the text memory (Don't have it off hand).  But then you can do something like this: (this is only puesdo)                           memlocation = MK_FP(address etc)                                        char = *memlocation;                                                    memlocation += 2;                                                       I believe you need the += 2 because the screen memory contains 2 bytes  for each character, one is the ASCII rep, the other are attributes      (colour mainly).  This can be done in a loop to read as much or as      little as required.                                                     memlocation is a pointer, char is a char (case you didn't figure that   out <GRIN>).                                                            I don't have any C code off hand, but depending on the mode your in you could read video mem directly. I don't like to do this so I would check some DOS calls (int21) in a Dos programmers reference. I think I did    something like this a while ago, I can't remember what it was. TCXL     windows can do this I think as well.                                        Ralph                                                               I did call the BBS a few nights ago, but I ran into problems with the   call-back validation since I am long distance (Guelph) from the BBS.  Tosave me (and your brother) any unnecessary trouble, could you tell me   the version number of the HACK source code?  I have an old, archaic (!) version of it that is written in (if I rem[AUGember          correctly)  M#:x=,MSC 4.0.  It won't compile properly on the       Borland C++ that I am using, even with heavy modifications.  The        executable just locks up.  I wonder if this source is the same...                                                                                                                       Andy Stedman                    If you want to be backwards-compatible with XT's and PC's (like my      wonderful system) then you can't use the Int 15h Joystick call, because these systems don't support it.  You have to go directly to the hardwarewhich is an extremely messy and time-sensitive procedure that I haven't yet figured out yet!  I've tried to do this before, but I'm going on    extremely skimpy documentation in the XT Reference Manual that has no   useful examples.  Maybe some other programming genius in this base can  help both of us...                                                                                                                                                                              Andy Stedman            Nuts, it wasn't my intent to cut out the XT user. Anyway as long as I   have hacked it this much does the int15 work on an AT. I think it must  because the fire buttons function, only the stick has trouble. It must  be something I've done. when I can get an ASCII upload working to his   system, I'll send the calls I've used in a routine so some one can tell me what I may have down wrong. The Que ref book isn't that helpful.     I have only done a little playing about, but I did use the BIOS routinesand had no problems with tr;Nf3.+':farfarfarfarfarfaYv9gaYv9garfaYv)v*rCWN3*m.                                  You had no problem and after that your message is unreadable due to linenoise I would guess. When I tried the int15 call the buttons return the same numbers. The joystick doesn't. Please repeat the message. Maybe    some code as well. In mine I use the union statement and set up the regsthen make the call. I try to print the regs that have the read values,  but it is never the same.                                                                           Ralph                                       I said, in the original, that I was able to use the BIOS call with no  problem. Code?  It is only a line or two.                                       MOV DX,0        ;set call                                               int 15H        ;get switches                                            test al,40h        ;check switch one                                    jnz xxx        ;branch if button pressed, etc.                          mov dx,1        ;set for call                                           mov ax,8400h        ;this should also be at start                       int 15h        ;get joystick data in ax,bx,cx,dc                   The tech manual that I have says that you should check the BIOS date before making the call.  It does not work for BIOS's dated              11/08/82                                                                Might someone please write about immage scanning ?  Would it be possibleto scan drawings and cartoons in pc format ?  Most graphics stuff is forMac users, I guess...  Is there such a thing as renting time using an   image scanner ?  At UW maybe ?                                                                                                                  It would be nice to be able to upload some art.  Gallery spaces are     ok, but limited.                                                                                                                                ?                                                                       RE: Trying to read text from the screen..                                                                                                       I got it working now with the help of the Window routines that Mark     Longo made...                                                                                                                                   Now I have another question -- what's the bit-layout for the text       attributes (every second byte)?                                                                                                                 And yet another question: What's the quickest way to count the number oflines in a file? The only way I can think of is going through a loop of fgets() calls and updating a counter for each call (assuming that the   length of the lines are less than the array pointed to in the fgets()   call...). Is there an easier way of doing this???                                                                                               BTW, thanks to all those that helped with the screen-reading information!!                                                                      Supposedly the stick part of joystick handling is the hardest--you have to check time sensitive registers, I believe (if I remember correctly)  to determine the position of the stick--relative to what I don't know!  I couldn't figure out how to use the values from the pathetic           documentation that I had, so I gave up--the matter wasn't that pressing. I believe that the control of the buttons is the easiest part.                                                                                 Good luck!  If you get anymore info, let me know!                                                                                                                                       Andy Stedman                    What you need is a copy of Peter Norton's "programming guide to the IBM PC.  Al that information is in it.  The problem with questions like thison a BBS is that by the time you grab the book and find the section, theBBS has hung up on you.                                                                                                                             Off the top of my head:  in colour modes the byte is split into two four bit nibbles.  High order nibble is the foreground, and low the     background.  Within the nibble, high bit is brightness, remaining three bits are colour. In monochrome, the bits are also 4/4, but the bits are brightness, underline, blink, and reverse video.                          colours are 0-black, 1-blue, 2.green, 3- cyan, 4-red, 5-purple,       6-brown 7-white                                                         I think that is right, but like I said, you should get the reference    manuals.                                                                Thanks for the info! Would I be able to pick up the Norton's ProgrammingGuide to the IBM PC at the University book store? Approx. how much does it cost?                                                                                                                                        What are some other good reference books to get?                        Great. I'll try and work that into C code again. I tryed doing the call exclusively in C. I'll see what happens. Thanx                                             Ralph                                                I shall try based on what has been said to me on this base. Who would ofthought a joystick could be so much trouble.

Right--it makes you wonder how other game programmers have done  it, and whether it was worth the effort!  Of course it is though,       because then you never have to tamper with it again.  You have all the  reusable code that you need.                                                                                                                                                            Andy Stedman                    I can't recall the exact layout, but it contains the following.         As I said before there are two bytes for every character.  The second   byte is the attribute, and contains 4 bits for the foreground, 3 bits   for the background, and 1 bit for blinking...That is why you always see programs that allow the changing of colour to only give 16 foreground   colours and 8 background colours...If I find a book that has this in it,I will tell you.                                                           Hi Everyone,                                                                                                                                      I am writing an install program for a project I programmed at      school and I've almost got it finished.  The only drawback is that I    have to use the shell command to copy the files to the specified        directories because I can't figure out how to write a file copying      algorithm in C.  I downloaded a file a while ago that claimed to copy   files using a "large buffer", but it requires assembler routines that   I'm not familiar with.  Is there any way to accomplish this task?       Thanks in advance                                                                                                                               .\lan                                                                   Justin, I believe you stated and I agreed that morality came out of needto survive in a group. However, where we part company is when you state that morality is not needed anymore. That it has been replaced by the   institutions of the police and other law-makers and enforcers. Think of the chaos that exists now. Multiply that by 100 and you would have the  result of a society that does not believe in morality. Those who think  like you are a definite minority. I wonder if you have any children and how you instruct them. Even if you don't have children, imagine how you would instruct and let me know. Be realistic. Take into account a       child's lack of world experience and limited abstract thinking. How do  you convey your ideas to the child? And remember, children don't listen the first time around. Or at least they seem to forget awfully quick.   TTYL                                                                                                                     Mike                      I'm using Telemate v3.01 as well with no problems here.  Perhaps     you got a bad connection when you were downloading.  Occassionaly there are problems with line noise that everyone gets.  Zmodem is an excellentprotocol, it shouldn't give you any problems.                                                                                                   .\lan                                                                                                                                           I am interested in contecting with the COMPUSERVE network.              Can any one tell me about their experience with this service?           Do they have a local access number (in Kitchener) or do you             have to connect through Datapac? What is the cost of using              Datapac (per hour) ... on top of the COMPUSERVE charges?                In fact what are the COMPUSERVE fees?                                                                                                           Thanks.                                                                 does any one here have the adress to lpt1,lpt2? and the listing on what bits do what or address do what?? and if so any information on          programming it?                                                                                                                                         ex.        strobe =-= adress?                                                      data   =-= address?                                                     acknowlege ******                                                                                                            like that??                                                                             Thanks Emil                                             You can do it quite easily infact.  What you need is a reference manual.You simply open or fopen a file and that will give you a handle to it.  Then with a defined buffer size, loop while it is not NULL and read or  fread from the specified handle.  Then make sure you close or fclose.       Thanks for the reply, Joseph!                                                                                                                     I think I have the "jist" of what you are saying, but I'm not too clear on it.  Do you mean to have two file pointers: the first one to   open the file, and the next one to write the file -- then I would use   fread (of fgets, whatever), to get the data into a buffer and write it  out to the second file?                                                                                                                         .\lan                                                                   Thanks very much for your help so far.  I'll check the HACK version     number and get back to you...  I'm still interested in checking out yourbrother's board, even if it is long-distance!  Maybe I can call after 11or on weekends to cut down on the bill.  Still, it's only to Kitchener.                                                                         Thanks again for your help.                                                                                                                     Andy Stedman                                                            Wonder of wonders!  I checked my Hack version number (and it took less  time than I thought to find it) and, lo and behold, it is version 3.51s also!  Did you, by chance, ever upload this source to some Guelph BBS orBoss?  I wonder how I got it.  I have a strange feeling that I got it   off Boss at some point, long ago...  Oh, well.                                                                                                  When you said that you actually got the Hack source to compile, did you get it to work?  Or just compile?  After a huge effort (especially on a clunky 10 Mhz XT) I got it to compile, but it locked up (or seemed to,  there was such a long pause!) when it loaded and displayed some message that a file was missing, if I remember correctly.  If you did get it to work correctly, well, that's a bit heartening!  I'm using Turbo         C++/Borland C++ at the moment.  I have Turbo C 2.0 also that I might    try, because it compiles faster.                                                                                                                I'm still interested in being validated on the BBS, if you haven't      already done so.  If you want me to call you for this purpose (or       whatever), I'll do so.  You number's 579-3819, if I wrote it down       correctly.                                                                                                                                      Thanks very much for your help.  I'll let you know if I can make any    progress with this nightmarish source!  Hack needs more comments, more  descriptive variable names, and fewer gotos!

If you ever find out where a Moria source is located (I'm thinkingthat there might be one on Compuserve...), please let me know.  If it's ever useful, my voice phone is 837-2217.                                so where is everyone hiding these days???  and why aren't you posting?  geez this place is dead...look there goes a tumbleweed blowing by!           Hi everyone,                                                                                                                                    I am writing a program in Turbo C, which must be able to determine the number of disk drives on a particular system.  I use one of the TC  functions to accomplish this, and it returns a variable of type int.    That's fine, but I want to convert this int number back into the actual drive letter it represents (Ex. if it returns 3, I want to be able to   get C).  The only way I can think of to do this is to add 64 to it, and print it as %c.  I thought of using enumeration to accomplish the task, but I don't seem to be having much success.  Any suggestions?  Thanks inadvance.                                                                                                                                        .\lan                                                                   Yes I did get it to compile, and yes it did work but it had some bugs.  The screen wasn't writing properly so the display was somewhat garbled. I compiled it using Quickbasic (forget the version)  It was also about  two years ago and a LOT of work.  Moria?  I remember playing it a coupleof years ago.  In my opinion its the best 'hack' type game ever made.   I've never seen any source anywhere though...  If i see it I'll letcha  know.  Sorry 'bout the bbs being down.  It was great for 38400 bps      callers, but 2400 bauder's it was a pain because you couldn't abort any menus because the modem was buffering too far ahead.  I'm re-writing it to disable the high-tech functions for 2400/1200/300 users.  It'll be upin a day or two....                                                                                                                             Tell me a bit about this project you're working on.  Are you trying to  make hack to modify it?  or starting a similar game from scratch?  Are  you trying to make it work over a bbs?  If so, I've got some ideas for  ya.                                                                          I'll give ya a shout sometime on the weekend.                          Rich                                                                i'll consider it.                                                       Try GENIE a lot cheaper $6.95 a month with unlimited use of basic       services and local access direct...downloading costs about $6.00 an hour,but there is loads of stuff that is free including some games....      I'm here, as ever, but I think I got bowled over by a gargantuan        tumbleweed!                                                             It is dead everywhere, is this the equivilent of a BBS summer hiatus?   Can't say I'll miss Justin, tho....                                     It is about 40 bucks, and should be avaialable at the unniversity books store.  If you want to go all out, get a copy of the IBM technical      reference manual from IBM.  It is about 300 bucks.

Yes,  I have a 9600 baud, but it is not HST.  It is v32, v42.  I        have a dual standard here, and hope to install it shortly.  That        should do the trick.                                                                                                                            Ok.   Your problem is not trivial.  The real problem is that the        only common thing on all machines is the time of day clock,  and        it  has a resolution of about 55 MS., about 18 times per second.        It is not good enough for what you want.  You can trap int8, and        use  that,  and you could also increase the freqency by a factor        of about 10, then execute an int 8 every  1/10  clock  tick.  In        assembler,  that  is  probably  the way that I would do it.  The        real problem is that a <CNTR C> out, or any abort  is  going  to        crash the system, as you will not get to put the interupt back.                                                                                     I  wrote  a  program with an accurate clock requirement, and        what I finally settled on was a dumb delay loop.  But so that it        would be accurate, I wrote a small init routine that benchmarked        the timing loop at  the  start.   IE-read  clock,  loop  100,000        times,  read  clock. (about a 1.5-2 second startup delay. A good        place to display the logo.  Then do the divide to calc the  size        of  a  75  MS delay.  That is reasonably simple, and should give        you accuracy that is good enough for most stuff.                                                                                                    The other solutions will not work on  XT's.   You  MIGHT  be        able  to  use  the sound generation chip, as that is the channel        two timer and is common to all PC's as well.  I remember  toying        with  the  idea, and deciding that while possible, it was a hell        of a lot of code compared to the  dummy  way  I  just  outlined.        -----------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                                                                         Thanx don ... they way u described was exactly how I ended up doing   it.  I was really surprised whenI found out how limited the timer was.  I was also thinking of using the sound chip as the timer too, but like usaid the other way works just as well.

Now if there is away to avoid the Long                   Distance line to TO ... or to avoid the $10.20 per hour to use          DATAPAC ... then great.                                                                                                                         Does the local number that GENIE uses involve no other fees             (other that the $6.95) to use?                                                                                                                  I have also just read the message for Colene Alen ... all info is much  appreciated                                                             Colene ... do you know how many people are connected to GENIE ...       Compuserve is some where around 750,000 (plus) ... Thanks for your info ...

Can I            logon to the system? If so how?  I am looking to connect with           the Compuserve Network which has a local number in Toronto ...          I don't know if I can do this a avoid the $10.20 per hour               DATAPAC charges ot connect with Compuserve. Of course it would          be much nicer to connect at no charge or (25 cents an hour).            I don't know if you can help in this area or not. If you can            thanks.                                                                 It seems rather crude, doesn't it?  But then a lot of times the best wayis the simplest awy.                                                    All the adults gone home?                                               Never muscle in on something that is already happening...bad news..     But...if something is meant to happen it will...be patient and see what happens.......                                                                     speaking from experience                                     No some of us are still here ....patiently waiting...why don't you startus off with some very intellectual adult conversation....I have almost  forgotten what it is all about...especially when my only company at homeis a three year old...                                                  I guess it must be the weather , everyone is actually hiding            outdoors...you know doing the sports thing...well some of us anyway..   Sultan thinks he is a great athlete....hahahaha ..I know I laugh pretty hard when he talks about how good he is...I hear through the grapevine  that are somewhat associated with the Macho Man...I feel for you too... It is really unfortunate when we have to subject ourselves to such      punishment...but hell it is a dirty job ...and somebody has to do it    right....???!!!

Charles DeLint you say....Ya I read him, excellent stuff!! I spent some time in Ottawa a few years back and read several of his Ottawa based    stories then. One of the places where the Other world poked through in  Ottawa was at the end of the street where I lived! talk about mixing    fantasy and reality! I even met the guy once in a cool SF bookstore     there call the House of Speculative Fiction.                                                                                                    University Blues? What about OSAP? What about the Co-op programme? Idid Co-op biology and was able to pay my way through with the money saved   from work-terms (No parents and no OSAP!).

I never thought they would even   join the twentieth century and put their catalogue on-line. How about   that! Thanks                                                            Well, I like ghosts!

Hi everyone,                                                                                                                                      I am attempting to write a very simple program in Turbo C to      display the free disk space on a given drive.  I think that I have all  of the logic correct, but I can't get the program to actually display   the amount of bytes free.  The function that I coded that actually      determines the free disk space looks like this :                                                                                                void findfree(int drive)                                                {                                                                          struct dfree *stat;                                                     stat = (struct dfree *)malloc(sizeof(struct dfree));                    getdfree(drive,stat);                                                   printf("Total Space: %lu\n",stat->df_total*stat->df_sclus*stat_df_bsec);                                                                        printf("Free : %lu\n",stat->df_avail*stat->df_sclus*stat->df_bsec);     free(stat);                                                          }                                                                                                                                               I checked the values of stat->df_avail, stat->df_sclus, etc, and they   all are the correct values.  It seems when I multiply them all together,the value is not displayed correctly by printf.  I checked my manual,   and I found that the unsigned long type should be able to hold a limit  of 4294967295, and I know that there are not that many bytes on the diskdrive that I tested my program on.  For some reason, when I run it, it  tells me that I have 69632 bytes - far from the real value of 33427456  bytes total disk space.                                                                                                                           I don't understand why it's giving me the wrong values... Am I        overlooking something?  Thanks.                                                                                                                 .\lan                                                                   Oh, let's see what you say, the NEXT time i pound you, you litlle wimp !Paper bag eh ?????, i'll show you wet the next time i'm there !

Greetings Alan,                                                                                                                                 While I cannot say for Turbo C, the equivalent call for Microsoft       returns a similar structure that contains some unsigned values.  Note   that when you multiply unsigned values, the result is unsigned, NOT longunsigned (as you are using for printf).  In order to evaluate the       expression properly, the compiler needs a hint about the resulting valueyou expect.  The easiest way is to cast one of your arguments long.                                                                             For example, assuming a,b,c are unsigned ints:                                                                                                    a*b*c                                                                                                                                         is calculated as an unsigned (16 bit) value, whereas:                                                                                             (long unsigned) a*b*c                                                                                                                         is calculated as a long unsigned (32 bit).  Note that the cast applies  to "a", not the entire expression.  The compiler knows that if you are  multiplying a long by an unsigned, that the intermediate result should  be long, etc.                                                                                                                                   What is happening with your function is that the intermediate value     overflows the precision of an unsigned AND is also the wrong type of    argument for your printf.

I see the error I have made now.  Thanks for clearing it up --      everything that I did _seemed_ logical at the time, but I think I       understand your explanation.  As always, your help has been most        beneficial.  Thanks!                                                                                                                            .\lan                                                                   One day dopy (of the seven dwarfs) enters a church and askes the nun if ther are any dwarf nuns at this church.  The nun replies," I am sory    Doppy but there are no dwarf nuns at this church.  The next day Doppy   goes back to the chuch and askes the nun." Sister are there any dwarf   nuns in the city?"  The nun again replies that there are no dwarf nuns  in the city.  The next day doppy askes the nun, "Sister are there any   dwarf nuns in all of Ontario?"  The nun tells Doppy that she does not   know if there are but she will ask Mother Mary.  When she comes back shetells Doppy that there are no dwarf nuns in all of Ontario.  The next   day Doppy again asks the num if there are any dwarf nuns in all of      Canada.  The nun replies," I will have too ask mother Mary about that." the nun comes back and agian tells Doppy that there are no dwarf nuns inall of Canada.  The following day Doppy arives back at the church with  the other 6 dwarfs and askes the nun," Sister are there any dwarf nuns  in all the world?"  The nun again does not know and goes to get mother  Mary.  Mother Mary comes out to queston Doppy's bizare interest in dwarfnuns.  "Doppy",says Mother Mary,"there are no dwarf nuns in all the     world. Why do you want to know?" Doppy frowns as all the other dwarfs   chant "DOPPY F---ED A PENGWIN!!!!

Now we couldn't possibly be talking about the same sultan i've heard    about ...the sweet, generous, innocent, pure, <cough> <cough>  excuse I think i have something caught in my throat  (maybe vomit?)              re:  place to have sex                                                          If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.                                                                 Colene                          You keep the poems you wrote and actually go looking for them??? Isn't  that a little painful (or a you a masochist at heart)?? But on a        positive note, I like them (I think they are good).                     Nope...what happened is all the children revolted and they took over theadults' computers....Blame the school system because they gave the kids the holiday....Now that children are not away, the adults cann't play.

I wasn't able to get on  for several days initially, and then I just lost interest (strangely)   for a period of time in BBSing in general--I had almost forgotten about our message thread.  Accept my sincere apology... :-).                                                                                          What I'm trying to do is re-write (or write from scratch, if you like) agame similar to Moria (the best!)/Hack/etc. the way I think it should bedone.  I've thought about making it BBS compatible (that would be a     really great feature, I agree), if I could do it reasonably.  Another   interesting feature would perhaps be a multi-player mode (if I can make this workable--especially regarding the necessary modem handling) where it is maybe possible for two players (by chance, of course!) to meet up in a dungeon.  So far, however, this project hasn't really gone         anywhere.  My motivation seems to be going on and off!  I can't         completely decide whether I want to program it in C (with which I'm     experienced) or in C++ (which seems more logical, but about which I knowfar, far less).  I've been trying to build a logical structure in C++,  but I've been having trouble with this.  I could use an expert's advice on this topic!                                                                                                                                  Any suggestions?  And, you say you compiled HACK with QuickBASIC?  Don'tyou mean QuickC?

Costner did  an incredible acting job, and the movie was loaded with stars.  The neatthing was that the movie reveals a lot of things that you didn't know a thing about.  I was impressed with the facts that were presented, and   the way that they were presented.  I came away from watching it with    this strong desire to go to the library and pull out the transcripts of the Warren Commission Report.  One to put on the most worth seeing list.                                Colene Allen                            Tell me.

Ok!!!!                                                  Hi everyone!                                                                                                                                    Haven't been around here in a long time...real busy lately.  Just       thought I'd drop a note and say that I'm running Os/2 2.0 -- so far I'm quite happy with it.  Its DOS support is superb, although the Windows   support is a little slow (to be expected, after all it, it does have twolevels of translation to go through for the API calls!).  Its seems goodand stable too.  Not much can crash the whole system (PCBoard does a    good job, though).                                                                                                                              The multitasking is quite good -- disk access is fully background (at   least with my DMA scsi controller it is) -- including formatting of     floppies or hd's.  It is quite smooth too.  Was playing Stunts (race carsimulation) in a 320x200 window (on 640x480 screen), with Os/2          translating from 256 down to 16 colours, while copying an 80 meg file   from one drive to another, AND while OS/2 was having a game of chess    against itself in expert mode... it wasn't SNAPPY, but it was still     quite playable.  Switch into full screen mode and it was smoother than  a stand-alone machine...                                                                                                                        ... Say, anyone recommend any good dBase books?  I have a fairly large  project to do, and must use dBase.  Nice and easy, but I don't know all the tricks, and don't want to spend ages trying to figure them out.  Anyhelp would be appreciated.                                                                                                                      Paul.                                                                   Yes, you got it !  Di is probably only good for one thing and that is   ___ ???? Hmmm, maybe the only thig she's good for is *&$ !              I own a motorhome, and it is really kind of a turn on to pull it up to  the curb in front of one of the stores. . . two to three feet from wherepeople are walking, pull the curtains, and have a great time with many  people walking by so close.                                                                                                                     Actually my main concern is not whether morality has been replaced, in  fact, by police/enforcement/etc.  Whether it has, or hasn't, whether it can or can't --                                                                                                                                 I would like to just ask a few simple questions:                                                                                                WHY would it be a bad thing if a lot of peoples lives suddenly became a little less safe?  If your answer is a moral answer, then you are faced with a dilemma.. you are saying "morality is worthwhile because without it an immoral thing would happen."  Which is rather humorous, if not    very cogent.                                                                                                                                    Secondly -- having lived as a human being for some number of years now, I am pretty familiar with the ways in which people react to situations  they don't like.  Very rapidly they construct things which aid them.  I am willing to bet that a society without morality would VERY rapidly    find new ways to control itself.  The most obvious and immediate way    being the development of new power structures (ie: people banding       together in various ways and combining their efforts toward winning someadvantage over someone or something else).                                                                                                      I don't think any effort would be required at any overall level to try  and adjust the situation.  I think that, due to the human drive to      conquer/succeed, things would work themselves out -- and rather quickly.                                                                        I suggest that any argument you can generate to the contrary rests on   some premiss "But it would be bad because of X, where X is immoral."                                                                            RE: how do I / would I instruct my children?

Justin                                                                                     RE: Value subjective                                                                                                                                                                                                    More to the point --                                                                                                                            Value is a human creation.  And not just an arbitrary one either.       Something is made valuable for a reason.  People define the value of    things out of a need to become stronger and better.  When society feels that it needs individuals who will go out and get killed in some war, itdeclares that "bravery" and "patriotism" are valuable.  When an         individual is hungry, they declare that "food" is valuable.  And this   percolates backwards: something which helps you get something valuable  becomes valuable for this reason.  So money becomes valuable because it can be used to acquire food.... a simple concept for which I'm sure you can imagine a million examples.  At the societal level things percolate backwards as well.  When "patriotism" is valuable, then perhaps society also declares that there is value in the idea that individuals owe      something back to society -- because this may serve to increase the     number of patriots.                                                                                                                                                                                                     It is hard to call this "subjective" because it is a general principle  which applies to individuals, or groups, or anything.  Their individual evaluations may be viewed as subjective, but only so far -- they would  like, in some cases, that everyone agree with their evaluations because then they might be able to achieve their ends more easily.                                                                                                                                                              As for "good" and "evil" -- when viewed this way it turns out that they are simply evaluations like any other.  Patriotism is "good" and being aturncoat is "evil" for the same sort of reason that "money" is good:    evaluating it this way helps to achieve some end goal (individuals      willing to die in battle in the former case, and food in the latter).                                                                           This is not just a trivial and unimportant issue.  Notice that in one   situation what was declared "good" might be declared "evil" in another  situation -- because the goals have changed.  If society is on the vergeof extinction and needs to greatly increase its numbers, then perhaps   individuals willing to throw their lives away in a fight will be viewed as one of the most evil things of all.  And then self-interest will be  declared good, and the idea that you owe something back to society will be seen with disgust and mistrust.                                                                                                                                                                                      I talked here mostly in terms of "society" for my examples, because I   think the examples are a little clearer -- but I also insist that these definitions apply equally well at all levels.

Greetings! I am looking for mature players who are familiar with the    Classic war game of Diplomacy. I am in need of 6 players who are        interested in beginning a play-by-mail game. Interested parties should  have moderate or better familiarity and skill at Diplomacy. Owning a    copy of the board game is not necessary but may be helpful. I will      referee and keep track of all details of the game as well as write the  outcome to each player for each turn. The game will take approx. 16-24  weeks or more (Don't blame me - Blame Canada Post!). If you are         interested or want further information either call John at 725-7977 or  send a note and self-addressed stamped envelope to:                     J.

HABS suck beans? Do you know which team you're talking about buddy? Do  you think they won all those Stanley Cups because they SUCK? I think    not!                                                                    Let me guess...you're either a Leaf fan, a Nordiques fan, or one of     those Pittsburgh bandwagoners...?                                                                                                               Anton Milardovic                                                        Hi, I have uploaded something you should find useful. It's in the       utility section and is called DOSREF17.ZIP. It desribes the memery and  I/O maps as well as the interrupts. As to the lines for the printer     interface, I worked with it before. I'll see what I can find. You could try even the KPL. They do have books on interfacing through standard    ports on an IBM machine. There is only a few lines to be concerned with on a centronix interface.                                                                            Ralph                                      Hi, I have a question for you about OS/2 and disk controllers.          A friend of mine used a SCSI  and he had                                no problem with background formatting etc..  Would I be able to do that with my IDE controlled drive?  Also would my stacker mess things up at  all?  Also, I have a 386-33 no copro is this too slow? and how bad is itusing OS/2 with the minimum 4Meg ram?                                                                                                           I guess you should probably charge for this review, but thanks in       advance for your help.                                                                                                                          Also, concerning dBase, I did a contract in 1990 and I started it using dBase III and had to write all of my own menu driven input routines and then we got dBase IV and of course by using their built-in pull down    menus etc. half of my programme worked much wuicker than the other.  AllI can say is that the dBase language is definately not the quickest, andI therefore suggest that you make use of as many of their "built-in" (tothe language) functions and this will speed things up while reducing    your flexibilty a bit.                                                                                                                          This was meant to be P-mail, but I guess I messed up.

Sultan...or  Dianne ...I'd say go with the older one...                              Gee ...sorry about that I lost this messsage the other day because my   boss walked in on me ...Anyway..I will comment on Men are Tasty Meat..  HA i think they are just about the toughest things to chew and they     always get stuck between your teeth...                                  A wise man never plays leap frog with a unicorn.                        A man walks into a bar and sees a sign on the wall. "make the mule laughand win $100.00" So the man walk`s up to the bar tender and say`s that  he like to try for the $100. The bar tender told him to go head. The mangoes over and whispers something in the mules ear. Next thing the bar   tender see in the mule rolling on the floor laughing. The man goes to   the bar tender to get his $100. The bar tender gives it to him. A week  later the same man walks into the bar a week later and see a sign again.This time it say "make the mule cry and win $100" The man asked the bar tender if he could have anther try. The bar tender said sure but if you win you have to tell what you said. The man said OK. The man goes over  to the mule and whispers something in the mules ear, and then the mule  starts rolling on the floor crying.                                     At this point the bar tender can`t believe what he is seeing. When the  man comes over to collect his money the bar tender said you have to tellwhat you said to the mule. The said well the first time whispered into  his ear I told him that my dick was longer then his, and the second I   showed him.                                                             Hi Paul,                                                                                                                                           I'm doing a little work with SQL specific databases right now; most  of the work I'm doing is in Oracle.  I know that dBase does support SQL,and there are plently of SQL manuals out there you can look at.  I'll   look up some titles and see if I can find some manuals that are dBase   specific.                                                                                                                                          On the note of OS/2, I was considering purchasing a copy of it       myself.  What kind of machine are you running on?  I'm hoping to buy    OS/2 with a new 486-33 machine that I'm buying soon.  Anything you find particularly impressive about OS/2?                                                                                                             .\lan                                                                      I wasn't aware the Borland C++ v3.1 was out.  Where did you buy it?  I just purchase BC++ v3.0, and sent in the registration.  Jeez, I wonderhow much the upgrade will cost.  This new version supports windows 3.1, right?                                                                                                                                             In the line of tutorials, I would suggest you learn C before going   onto C++ -- books by the Waite Group Press are very good to learn from. In addition, you might want to consider getting "The C Programming      Language" (2nd edition), written by Kernighan and Ritchie.  An excellentbook, but a tad expensive.                                                                                                                      .\lan                                                                   Does anyone know the numbers for RGB.. I have had quite a time locating them. I used to havetheir numbers in my telix directory, but i forgot tosave them when I re-formatted my drive for the OS/2 HPFS... Anyhow, I   was thinking of joining again, but cannot get on.... <g>                                                                                        Thanx.

TTYL                                            Is there ANY-ONE out there that has ever used or is using the enable    comm. program?

Thanks all folkssssssssssssssssssssss             Well I've anoyed everyone else I might as well try the pro if you know  anything of the enable comm. programm plEEEEEAse send me a message.     Well Dave thats very interesting and all but (and you know I hate to be an A** hole but,) do you know anything about ENABLE? If not maybe a     friend does.                                                            Please drop me a letter                                                 Looking forward to it. No I'm still looking.                            Again, does ANYONE know the number(s) for RGB.. I lost my phone         directory, (no backup.... arrrrgh) and I need to call                   Use EMM386 ... it is both a EMS and UMB provide, if you just need the   UMB specify NOEMS on the command line in CONFIG.SYS                     It is not a good idea to learn C before C++.  Many books today state    that good C programmers find the two quite different.  The semantics aregenerally similar, but the logically thinking and structure setup is    totally different.  If Lester wants to know C with a bit of C++         structuring, fine learn C first.  But if he wants to use polymorphing,  derivation, inheritance etc... learn C++ without C.                     You have to hear this...about two weeks ago PC WEEK was testing OS/2 andWindows 3.1 out.  Speed wise Windows 3.1 beat OS/2 in almost every test (including Windows/OS/2 complimant programs like Corel Draw).  But when they testing OS/2 on a 486/33 with 4 megs (IBM's recommanded lowest), ittook Excel over an 1 and a half to load a 100K data file ... I am       serious too (and that was when they killed the process <GRIN>), holy eh?It goes to show you,never go by the 'requried' specs make sure you have at least 8 megs on OS/2.  And another bad thing about OS/2 is its       thrashing ... it does it too much ... to often ... partly because of theWork Place Shell (WPS).  It is such a pig and hog it is unbelieveable.  While it is good looking, simply open a folder makes the disk start     swapping like mad (thrashing).  It is pretty solid though.  I have had  WP for Windows kill the entire system...and on occasion the WPS has     bottomed out, but since when has a piece of software not had a few      annoying bugs.  As PC weeks called it...'A diamond in rough', release   2.1 should fix some of this.                                            I was wondering is somebofy out there could help me.                                                                                                    I am writing a program in Pascal, that requires the heads of thehard disk(s) to be parked.  I am unsure as to how this is accomplished. Does anybody out there have parking code in C, Pascal, basic or ASM?                                                                                    If so, could you please upload it (or explain it here) ?                                                                                        Thank you kindly, I appreciate it....                                                                                                                                                   Ryan Sweet              Anyone out there want to take some old Turbo C manuals off my hands     for a nominal fee ?                                                     What does everyone think of the TV coverage we are getting ?            I think it absolutely ABYSMAL !! NBC is so damned biased, but we have   learned to expect that from the Americans. CTV is just plain hokey.     I'm sure at least half the airtime is spent on commercials and those    god-awful human interest stories and the little cultural tours round    Barcelona.                                                              If you can tell me more about what the Enable comm program is supposed  to do, I might be able to help you make it work!  Go ahead...

I hate CTV coverage of anything.  Like Blue Jays baseball.  I hate that Furgie Olver guy and his stupid interviews.  Fergie: "I'm with Kelly    Gruber.  Kelly, you are struggling badly, why are you struggling?"      If I was the Gruber, I would punch Fergie in the face for asking stupid questions.                                                                                                                                      Also, I hate CTV's olympic song.  You know the one they play right      before the coverage.                                                    ->  Never muscle in on something that is already happening...bad        ->news..

What's your fetish?                                                     well Andy I finely figured it out, it's the damn instructions booklet   it's not very easy to comprehend. But I recently downloaded telix from  plexnet and when mI tried to boot it up it said that it was unable to   locate my modem on comm port two, yet thats where it is.  Maybe since I still have Enable hooked up it's not working.

Here are three numbers that I have for RGB.

These programs are relatively easy to  use and set up.  Sorry I can't be of help with the Enable program but I don't think that it is widely used.                                      d                                                           re:the grass                                                                                                                                            Actually, I think that I will leave that to your imagination.

I like the easy to understand help command, which shows you almost everycommand that you would ever need, and I find the Telix screens easy on  the eyes.

I would suggest looking at the University of Waterloo book store.    You can also get Waite Group Press books by ordering directly from them.If you need the address, let me know and I'll dig it up.                                                                                           I just got my Windows API Guide from Borland (free from the          registration), and I didn't notice any upgrade information included.    I'll probably call customer support and see if they have any info on it.BC++ 3.1 supports windows 3.1, right?                                                                                                           .\lan                                                                     Although I am not a very seasoned C++ programmer, I've been working   with C for a while now.  When I asked around about C++, many suggested  that learning C first is a better idea.  After all, C++ is a _super-set_of C (i.e. it includes all the functions of C, and more).  I can't      disagree with what you've said though.  I've also been told that many   good C programmers don't find a significant advantage to using C++ untilthey've used it for a long time.                                                                                                                  If you're learning both languages, I think that learning C first mightbe better because all of the C functions will work with C++, but that isnot necessarily true the other way around.  Moreover, you can easily getthe two languages confused when going from C++ to C.                                                                                            .\lan                                                                     That's true.  I must agree that 4 megs RAM is clearly inadequate for  OS/2.  My friend just purchased OS/2, and he had the bare minimum as    well (386 w/ 4 megs).  He told me that he couldn't believe how slow it  was -- it was accessing the disk drive constantly.  However, now that hehas 8 megs RAM, he tells me that his system is blazing fast.  I can     believe it.  I saw OS/2 work with a 386/33 with 8 Megs, an I couldn't   believe that it was a 386!  I can believe what you said about PC WEEK's article for sure.  I know there are bugs with OS/2, but on the whole,   it's pretty solid.  At the price it's going for right now, it's not a   bad buy either.                                                                                                                                 .\lan                                                                      Can anybody tell me about binary trees?  I've been hearing a lot     about them lately, but my information is kind of sketchy.  Any          information would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.                                                                                           .\lan                                                                   thax, I just got telix                                                  And everything seems to be working fine except it doesn't reconize that my modem is on port #2.

Again thanx also,                                                       I finally figure it out the manual just wasn't very easy to comprehend  and since I'm fairly new to modeming I had nothing to go on.

Use the alt P key, then 2 to select the port, then save to disk.        Kids can be a real drag, but then they only last for 20 years or so.    You just have to wait them out.  Actually, they are not too bad when    they are small.  You can always put them to bed early.  It is when they get to be 19 or 20 that they become a real pain in the ass.  1/4 child. 1/4 adult, and half-assed.  Too stupid to realize that their parents    woould occasionally like some privacy, yet they think they have inventedsex, and know everything there is about it.  It never seems to occur to them that their very existence proves otherwise.                        ->  Again thanx also,                                                   ->  I finally figure it out the manual just wasn't very easy to         ->comprehend   and since I'm fairly new to modeming I had nothing to    ->go on.

I am looking for mature players who are familiar withthe classic war game of DIPLOMACY!!! I am in need of 6 other players whoare interested in beginning either a play-by-mail game or perhaps a BBS version (where all moves etc. are done on a daily basis on line.)

I know they are talking to Edmonton about Vince  Damphouse.  It's likely that Damphouse will return to Toronto to play inthe Gilmour line.                                                       Well the leafs have been one of the top 5 NHL teams since the all-star  break.  More good news for the leafs: Pat Burns is their new coach..    It'll be a great season for them coming up this fall.                   Isn't the idead of state secrets being passed around encrypted on CD's  just a little far out?  Wouldn't it be simpler to just courier the info?A car that runs on water is an amusing idead, but has a problem, the wayyou describe it.  It appears that the car has no source of energy to do the eletrolysis, so it wouldn't work the way you describe.  (If it was  plugged into some external electrical source, then alright.  This would have to be nuclear, hydroelectric, or solar or we're back to fossil     fuels.)                                                                 As i remember, the main technical problem with electric cars was the    weight of the batteries, as the only type that had the power and the    endurance until recently was the lead-acid type, and enough of them to  run a car was far to heavy.  However, a few years ago a much lighter    sodium-sulphur battery was perfected, so electric cars may now be       workable as a common mode of transport.                                 What has the oil companies really scared is hydrogen fueled vehicles.   The advantage hydrogen has over electricity is that is can be used as   jet fuel, so all aircraft could actually be converted from kerosene to  hydrogen, as could ground vehicles, and there goes the petroleum fuels  industry.                                                               The problem with cost will be solved with the increase in scale, just as cost of refining gasoline was solved with economies of scale.  As to   all-stainless-steel construction, Delorien did make a production car    built that way (that he never meant to build it is unimportant).        Well, they aren't actually SUPPOSED to HIT each other, but that is the  style in which it usually gets played.

I am going to try it now.                                               From a quick look the file looks very interesting.                      The description says its for guys only.                                 Hope I will get in shape.                                                  I had already figured that much out myself.  Do you have information on the actual algorithm of binary-trees?                                                                                                        .\lan                                                                      It's not as hard as you might think.  I was under the impression thatC was indeed a very intimidating language to learn.  I learned it last  year for a school project, and found it not to be.  It just depends on  how you learn the language.  In fact, many of C's basic functions are   very similar to other high-level languages.  Loops, conditional         compares, and much more are very similar to BASIC and other languages.     In fact, things only get difficult when the discussion moves to      pointers, structures, etc.  These topics themselves are not impossible  to learn for even novices.  It is entirely possible to learn C and writeprograms without having mastered all of the advanced topics.  I know    many people, including myself, that have learned C straight from BASIC. Pascal although similar to C, is not a mandatory step towards learning  C.   Think harder about what you just said -- it's not at all true.                                                                             .\lan                                                                   What exactly does ENABLE do?                                                                                                                    Andy                                                                    I'm currently trying to move from C to C++ myself, and I'm finding it   difficult at times.  The problem with moving from C to C++ is actually  because C++ is a superset of C:  in some ways, it seems very familar,   yet various keywords and other syntax are often subtly changed, and thisis something that I find hard to get used to.  Also, C++ doesn't force  you to begin thinking in a completely different language-world like     another language transition would, and this can work against you also.  You can still program in C using C++, so you aren't forced to dive in.  I found the transition from BASIC to C far easier than the jump from C  to C++ (although OOP could be the main reason).                                                                                                 Perhaps, then, C++ is the one to learn first.  After all, once C++ is   learned, C would be ridiculously easy to understand--all the syntax is  there in both languages.                                                You shouldn't define terms using solely the words in the term!  Many,   many things could be defined uselessly in this way; ie.  a goat is a    goat; a green frog is a frog that's green . . .  How helpful.                                                                                   At the very least, you could have provided a slightly more informative  response, even if you didn't want to go into depth!  Tsk, tsk, tsk . . .                                                                        One question:  is Antonin Dvorak your real name?  :-)  If it isn't, you could at least have chosen a more notable composer (not to denigrate    Dvorak), such as J.S. Bach, L. van Beethoven, W. A. Mozart, F. J. Haydn,etc.!                                                                   RE:  "C is a very hard language."                                                                                                               Good luck!  C is a very simple language to learn and use.  It is very   logical and consistent.  It does not have a large variety of confusing  types or keywords.  Sincee there is no I/O built into C, you can make   the learning curve easier by chosing to use third-party software        libraries that you.                                                                                                                             What's so hard about C?  It's a language whose learning curve is        hindered by very few, if any, conceptual difficulties.                                                                                          Andy Stedman                                                            Fairly briefly, a binary tree, or B-tree, is a data structure similar toa linked list whose structure, when graphically represented, is similar to a tree.  Data is organized on the tree according to its key value in relation to other data items on the tree, like so:                                                                                              (An alphabetical example:)                                                                                                                                              Moose                                                                  /     \                                                              Goat     Mutton                                                        /  \         /    \                                               Garbage  Grape  Mop     Zachary                                                                                                    You search the tree like this:  Assume you are looking for the data itemwith the key value of "Mop."  You start at "Moose".  "Mop" is greater   than "Moose", alphabetically speaking.  You take the greater than branchof the tree, and come upon "Mutton".  Aha!  Mop is less than the value  of "Mutton", so the less than branch (below) is taken; and lo and beholdwe find the Mop!                                                                                                                                This is not really a very good example, though.  Searching an array for the required value would probably be faster in this case.  However, for long lists, this method is _very_ fast, especially when it is properly  optimized so that the top of the tree is exactly the middle value of allthe data structures, i.e. "m" or "n" when doing an alphabetical search. Each successive branch should be half-way between the remaining range,  i.e., below "M" would be the "F" and "T" branches (approximately).  An  example structure that could be used to implement a binary tree (in C)  would be:                                                                                                                                       struct node                                                             {                                                                               int keyvalue;        /* used to position structure in tree */           ...other data...                                                        struct node *lesser;                                                    struct node *greater;                                           };                                                                                                                                              (I hope I haven't made any mistakes in syntax!)

Andy Stedman                                                                    yep you're right it does. BC ++ 3.1 has tonnes of new features  and programs that work with 3.1 only too. Talk to customer support aboutit. They might be behind in their work. BTW call my bbs sometime The    United Systems Of Canada (519)6218484. I know, I didn't let you on  in the past, but it was a missunderstanding. Sorry. Hope to see you     around. Later                                                           But the functions are irrelevant.  If C essentially everything is a     function, they have very little keywords.  C++ offers more, different   functions ... some I like ... some I don't.  I would never user cout    over prinf (though streaming is good).  C++ is a lot different fromC. If you want to know functions, that is different than)wanting to know  the syntax, and the how to's of the languages...                        That price is now run out (unless they decided to continue it) ...      Enable is a function that will enable interrupts ... it is coupled with disable (of course to disable interrupts ... that is not including      NMI's).  It is not ANSI standard  (I think), but BORLAND, WATCOM, and MSinclude it in there libraries.  It is basically used to define a        CRITICAL SECTION of code (code that can't be interrupted).  It's biggestusefulness is in task switching ... while saving a task's info, you     wouldn't want to have an interrupt occur.  But one must becareful with  it, you don't want to miss interrupts for a long period of time.        THe movement from C++ to C is probably not as easy as you think.  If youuse C++ for its features and get used to them, C will be 'confusing'    since it will not offer these features (at least not in a straight      forward manner).  OOP is the difference that C doesn't offer.              I have to agree with you there.  I was actually thinking more along adifferent line; it just seems natural that since C++ is indeed a        superset of C, that going from C to C++ would be the next logical step. With your reasoning, there is another side : wouldn't it be equally as  difficult to go from C++ to C, if these subtle differences are apparent?Granted that you can do straight C programming with a C++ compiler, if  you are used to using the enhancements of C++, it still might be        difficult to go down to C.                                                                                                                         I am by no means sure of this, you can't possibly try both ways.  I  guess it's just a matter of opinion.                                                                                                            .\lan                                                                       Thanks, Andy!  The information you have given me along with other   information I have read has really tied some ideas together.  I have    another question though.  In a source text file that I downloaded, the  file mentioned that b-trees are slightly different than binary trees.   It says "These trees [binary trees], should not be confused with a      B-Tree, which is a similar but more complex data structure".  The       artcile then goes on to talk about binary trees.  Do you know the       difference at all?  Again, thanks for the information -- it is most     appreciated.                                                                                                                                    .\lan                                                                      I actually called Borland's customer support BBS today.  They were   quite helpful indeed.  Actually, I called to change my address, and I   asked about the upgrade while I was on the phone.  They told me to call the Canadian site, but it was already outside office hours.  Is there   new documentation for BC++ 3.1?  Thanks for the info.                                                                                           .\lan                                                                                                                                           P.S. -- I'll call your system sometime soon.  Looking forward to using  it.                                                                                                                                                I didn't know that the price offer was run out.  A friend of mine    purchased a copy of OS/2 v2.0 at future shop for $79 just last week.    When did the discount expire?  Hopefully it's still at that price!                                                                              .\lan                                                                   Electric cars are a viable transportation system now.  It really shows  the power of the oil and gas companies that they have maintained their  monopoly on transportation.  In England, you can buy an electric car    for $4000 (Canadian) that will do 70 miles per hour.                    You believe that morality could be replaced by people "banding"         together? Don't we have enough gangs who "band" together? Aren't a lot  of our problems caused by these "bands". People already band together inethnic groups. One group hates every other group. This is no            prescription for survival. This is a death sentence. Genocide.          As for telling your children to be stronger all I can say is you make a lousy parent. What about co-operation, learning to accept each person's differences? These are the ideas that need to be instilled in the young.Your path leads to the isolationism of pre-1865 Japan where anybody who wasn't japanese was killed on sight. Please rethink your views and if   you still think they're valid, please DON'T pro-create.                 I believe it ended at the end of July.  So that would mean ... too late.Sorry, but don't worry, unless you need it, it isn't worth it yet.  Too much space, and the WPS hogs CPU and thrashes.                          Is this what we're talking about?  I know all about the C function      enable() (BC++ and TC[++]) and disable().  I program in assembly        language as well, so I have to know about their ASM equivalents sti and cli as well.  I was under the impression that the ENABLE being discussedwas a software package that could be _installed_ named Enable.  I do    believe that I've seen references to a software package by this name!                                                                           Sorry for the confusion.                                                                                                                                                                Andy                            I do agree with your argument to some extent, _BUT_, it is also true    that within the dark domains of classes and structs (specifically the   functions within them), you find code that could have been directly     transplanted from C.  If I was to implement, say, an OOP windowing      library for myself, I could use TCXL (a C windowing library) to         provide the functionality.  It would be very similar to programming in  C.  The difficulty with moving from C to C++ is that you have to wrap   everything in a different package.  The internals are very similar,     though.                                                                                                                                         For example (a sample windowing library):                                                                                                       C:   wopen(WINDOW *w, ...);                                                  wclose(WINDOW *w, ...);                                                 ...                                                                                                                                        C++:  w.open();                                                               w.close();                                                              ....                                                                                                                                      The C++ would be somewhat more complex because (if you want to be reallyOOP-like) you have to construct a hierarchy of objects for the window   class.  This is not necessary in C.  More planning, therefore, often hasto go into a C++ program to make the hierarchy logical and intuitive.                                                                           Back to the example.  The inside of the libraries for the two languages could be very similar.  While the C example would have to refer to data contained in a C structure, the C++ would use the data contained in the window class.  The main difference is that C++ needs to add the         complexity (possiblly) of the hierarchy, virtual functions,             constructors, destructors, etc.  Isn't it really easier to not have to  think about such things and instead implement a program directly?  The  reduced syntax of C should make things simpler.                                                                                                 Andy                                                                    You're right; who can be _sure_ that either way is easier?  Since you   can't (obviously) try both ways, with the same person, you can't tell.  The reason I think going from C++ to C would be simpler is because C++  uses functions that could be used in C also.  By this I mean that many aC++ program uses C functions to perform tasks.  Borland doesn't supply anew run-time library for the C++ part of BC++.  This is because the samefunctions can be used in C++ the same way that they are in C.  The only difference is the overlying structure.  In C++, you have to do a lot    more planning to design a program.  You have to plan your object        hierarchy.  Hmmmm....  Do you design a new object to perform some       function?  Do you use inheritance?  A friend object or function?  Will  you have to re-think your entire hierarchy?                                                                                                     In C, on the other hand, you just write your new function, and use otherservices as you see fit.  Perhaps this is just a personal feeling, but  C++ almost drives me mad because I have to spend so much time thinking  everything out.  I'm about to embark on writing a game using C++ (unlessI fall back into C) and I'm having trouble deciding how to implement    many functions.  In C, if a game character is swinging a weapon at a    monster, I'd just use an attack() function that specified the weapon    being used, and a pointer (or something) to the structure for the       monster being attacked.  The function would resolve the problem.  In    C++, what do I do?  The character (an object) is holding a weapon object(or do I have specific objects for specific weapons?), and he swings it at a monster.  How does the attack work?  Do I call a character.attack()function to resolve it?  Or do I call a weapon.attack() function?  Is   this attack function a friend of the monster class, so that it can      reduce hit points and so on of the monster?  Or do I call a function of the monsters, say monster.wound(), and tell the monster that it should  be wounded?  I find this all very confusing....  That's why I thinl thatif you've mastered the subtle complexities of C++, you should have no   trouble using only a subset of your knowledge in C.                                                                                             Andy Stedman                                                            That's strange.  I was under the impression that a B-tree _WAS_ a binarytree!  Perhaps a B-Tree has a more sophisticated method of optimizing   the tree.  Also, it could be possible that a B-Tree is just a binary    tree that contains only key values and references to a different data   arrangement.  That probably doesn't make sense!  I mean this, sort of:                                                                          B-TREE:  ??                                                                                                                                                              Keyvalue:  345                                                       /                 \                                               Keyvalue 23           Keyvalue 768                                                                                              ... Like a binary tree, but no real data contained in the structures.   Instead, each node of the B-Tree references an offset (or something) in a disk file, or somewhere else that contains more info.  For example,   perhaps the node with the key value "Stedman Andy" could have a         reference to a user file on a BBS, while a binary tree _might_ have the user data contained in the structure with the key value.                                                                                        This is just an idea, of course--I really have no idea whether it's trueor not!  I have seen reference to B-Tree databases, though, and the way I described above seems to be the way they'd work.                                                                                              What information were you referring to that mentioned this?  Is it on   this BBS?  I do have a copy of the B-Tree software that is in the       Programmer's Base on this BBS...  Perhaps I'll check it out more        closely; maybe it has an answer....                                                                                                             Andy S                                                                     Oh well ... I'll check up on it and see for sure.  I was just hoping for something new for the new system I'm going to buy, but I guess DOS  might have to do <sigh>.                                                                                                                        .\lan                                                                      True enough.  Indeed, the complexities involved in the game you are  creating are enough to give anyone a headache.  I can see your point    about C++, and again we both have valid points.  I debate is not easily resolved.                                                                                                                                          Ugg ... I hate doing planning when I'm programming -- but that often leads me to a big mess of a code when I'm done :).  Perhaps C++ would   only tangle me up further, who knows?                                                                                                           .\lan                                                                       I downloaded a file that had C++ implementations of binary trees,   and included was a text file.  This text file briefly explained the     ideas behind the binary tree, and in the introduction, it mentioned thatb-trees are different that binary trees.  Since I don't know too much   about them to begin with, I just took it on faith.  Almost everyone elseI've talked to thinks that the two are the same thing.  Perhaps the     differences are so subtle that the two _are_ basically the same thing.                                                                              I have a question though.  Everything I've read about binary-trees  (or b-trees, or whatever), tells me that they are by far the fastest wayto search a large database for a particular entry.  Since it only has tosearch n/2 records instead of n, as in a sequential seek.  How does thiscompare to using fseek() in C?  Would the speed difference be really    that different?  For instance, if all I wanted to do was read the data  from a structure at a certian spot, wouldn't the speed be close to the  same?  Just curious.                                                                                                                            .\lan                                                                   Can anyone help out a rookie programmer? I'm desperately looking for a  qbasic compiler. Is there such thing? I've heard that such a program    does exist. Name your price. I'm desperate.                             I have just uploaded cobol6-5 to this board. It has a few source code   examples included. Realia (realcob) is another although it's limited to 500 lines, but has a nice debug feature worth trying.                   re: electric cars                                                                                                                                       One also has to consider the fact that the oil comapnies have   purchased the patents for most of the electric car designs in the world so that they would not be put out of business.  Their monopoly is bases (based) on more than the stupidity of the human race, but also on the   fact that the oil companies have stacked athe deck in their own favor.

The entire thing is a huge package. But I don't know if they have just upgrades. But I hope you can get it. Its really good package.

Call Today!                                                 I say we can the debate!  Both sides really do have valid points, and   ones that probably will never be resolved.  I have planning out programstoo, and I have the same problem with code getting into a snarled mess  when the project turns out (as it _always_ :-) does) to be more         complicated than I'd planned on!                                                                                                                I'm making the jump to C++, though, in some (futile?) hope that it will make me organize better, and then program more efficiently and get      things done faster.  So far, though, it's been a real headache.  Maybe, though, it'll save me in the long run.  When you're planning on writing a game of the style that I'm doing, C++ _does_ seem to fit:  after all, there are lots of objects:  potions, weapons, scrolls, books, armour,   monsters, etc.  Hopefully it'll all get straightened out!

According to my manual, fseek() is--as I had the feeling it was--a function to relocate the filepointer within a file when using the stream-based I/O library.  I think that the function you're thinking of is [pause again] bsearch()!                                                                                Hmmmm... you _do_ have a point there.  Searching a sorted array with    bsearch() and using a binary tree probably do have very similar search  times, and I'd even be inclined to think that bsearch() would be faster because you wouldn't have to keep moving through levels of pointers to  get to the next node as you would with a binary tree.  Probably, though,the chief advantage of a binary tree, though, would be the fact that youcould probably add new data items faster to it.  All you'd have to do isfind its correct place, and then add a pointer to it from the node      above.  Using the bsearch-array method, you'd often have to move half   the array to make room for a new element.  But, of course, sometimes a  binary tree can get sort of lopsided (say for example, the top of the   tree was the word "aardvark"--there'd be practically nothing on one     branch below, reducing efficiency), and need to be resorted as well.                                                                            I'd be interested to see how a well-optimized binary tree would perform as compared to a sorted array using bsearch() for finding the key item, and inserting and deleting items.                                                                                                               Andy S                                                                  A very popular software package exists called Microsoft QuickBASIC      (unless this is what you're referring to?) that, to my knowledge is ableto compile BASIC code--and this is BASIC code that uses functions, or   procedures, or whatever they're called, not line numbers.  Are you usingthe Qbasic that comes with DOS 5.0?  If so, I think that QuickBASIC     would work just fine.  I think the current version 4.5 (some other      people in this base might be able to correct me on this), and it is     likely available in most computer stores for $50-60.                                                                                            I understand that it is quite a good package (I've been lectured on thisbefore by Eric Stern!).  Why not check it out?                                                                                                  Andy S                                                                     I agree with you completely.  It is incredible how much the          automobile                                                              has shaped our society and culture.                                        You remember seeing air force personnel with jetpacks on, flying     above the ground on a manouver?  They were also in star trek and other  sci fi series.  Well something similar in in my parents old             encyclopedia.  It has a photograph and talks about the new invention    that will greatly improve people's lives.                                 It was a Everyman's Encyclopedia, published in Great Britain.         In 1937!                                                                   I'm with you -- let's forget about the debate.  Anyone who is        commited enough to learn either language will be able to form their own opinion anyways.  It was an interesting point to discuss all the same.                                                                             I thought I was the only one the gets tangled up in his own code :). Glad to know that I'm not alone -- except when I have to debug my own   code :).  I'll probably start learning C++ more intensively in the next few months; right now I've got enough programming to keep me busy.  All the same, when you finish your game, perhaps I could see a copy of it.  I'm always curious to see what's possible.  Good luck in the            programming!                                                                                                                                    .\lan                                                                      Actually, I was refering to fseek(), but after thinking over it more carefully, I see the mistake I made --  just some confusion.  I have    heard about bsearch() as well, and the points you made seem quite       logical.  I experience wears well with C, and there's no better way to  find out about it than trying it yourself.                                                                                                         An interesting point you raised about balancing the tree.  That seemsto be the biggest problem with b-trees (or binary trees, whatever) : Howdo you write a good algorithm to ensure that the topmost branch is      exactly the middle of the items in the tree?                                                                                                       In the text file I mentioned before, it discussed some ideas is      balancing a tree; they called it the AVL algorithm (named after the     people that created it).  In this algorithm, the idea is to balance the tree such that there are close to an equal number of nodes on each side of the tree.  Of course, it is almost impossible to have a perfectly    balanced tree (they only occur in situations where there are 2^N - 1    nodes).  Therefore, the algorithm allows a 1-depth difference on either side.  They discuss routines to ensure this is true when adding and     deleting items from the tree.  Still this does not resolve the problem  of keeping the top node the middle item of the tree.  An intriguing     problem.  I guess the answer would lie in how you build the tree.  How  do you actually start a tree anyways? For instance : there are a lot of algorithms to help balance the tree, but you can't balance it until you actually have a tree to build on.  Do you know the ideas behind the     algorithm to start it and continue building on it?  It seems to be      puzzling me.                                                                                                                                    .\lan                                                                      I'm not sure if the DOS 5.0 QuickBASIC is able to make executable    code.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but this version is a _very_ limited    version of Q-Basic.  I can't be sure because I haven't done a lot of    programming in it.                                                                                                                                 All the same, I bought QuickBASIC v4.5, and to my knowledge, it's    still the most recent release.  Too bad I didn't use that for too long  either -- I was too anxious to learn C :).                                                                                                      .\lan                                                                   Thanks for the advice Don...I will definitely keep that in mind for nexttime....                                                                Well it is your call Richard...believe who you want...but the older one probably has forgotten more than the younger one can remember....       RE: why waste on useless things...you know I ask myself that question   everytime I talk to you....hahahahahhaha   gotcha                       The only cup the leafs are ever going to get is a JOCK CUP....hahahhhaa ooh stop it Dianne you are tooooo much....                              Stop nudging and winking I don't know what you are babbling             about...??!!!                                                           Ya you are right...maybe I was sleeping and all it was  was a           nightmare...aaaahhh it was worse than JASON LIVES.....                  Sorry guy I may get ticked off once in awhile at the JAYS ...but I am   still a die hard #1 FAN...no matter how much I yell at my tv....        So what brings you to the BOSS...???                                    Well I hope so...right now I have a friend who is trying to win me over to being a Leaf Fan...but you must admit they have had their problems ..Well you know a girl should never kiss and tell... but sometimes things happen and change when you are not expecting them to... I found out oncethat this guy liked me when I had a boyfriend and he just kept waiting  and asking and then it happened and we broke up and after awhile I foundout about this other guy but I wasn't sure because I was pretty fed up  with men...eventually we went out and had a great time but we didn't    live happily ever after ...he ended up getting a job in Ottawa but we   are still friends...one thing I have defintely learned is that you can  never have enough friends....hey they are much easier than relationshipstrust me....                                                            I use C++ becuase I have direct need for such its abilities, I merely   don't want to use it as a replacement for C.  The structural setup is   the main difference between the two.  For example an othello is much    more intuitive to write in C++ because it has direct objects.  While  I don't really need a destructor (scoping will handle it fine), or virual functions, a constructor is nice.  The variables would have to be       initialized anways, and the constructor allows for separating this task.Since there are tiles that is the base object, then a board, and then   split to stratedgy boards, a display board and the playing board.  This is not nearly as intuitive in C.  Those are things that make having the knowledge of C a hinderence.  You tend to look at structures            differently, and the thought process is different know ... that is      basically what I am saying.  SUre some programs don't require what C++  has, but in my experience thus far, these programs tend to be small and not very complex ... the more complex, the more C++ makes sense.        Personally I feel it would be harder to go from C++ to C.  If you use   C++ as it was meant to be then you no longer have the ability to do     these things in C.  At least with C you have a basis and it is possible to use your C code in C++ (not suggest).  THe reverse is not true, you  can't take C++ class/structure definitions (derivations, inheritence,   polymorphing etc etc) and do it in C.  If you can, then you might as    well use C, not C++, for you are not using the ideas that make up the   language.                                                               With your game, I find it quite easy to think of how it would work.     There would be character objects, weapon objects etc.  A character wouldhave a wound function (the actual hit points should not be public, this is data that only priveledged things should access), and weapons should have an attack proc, and possibly characters as well (depending on how  you implement it).  The it would be more like follows character.attack( Like follows:                                                           character.attack( monster )                                              -- check weapon in hand                                                 weapon.attack( );                                                        -- check if hit and then damage                                        monster.wound                                                            -- since it hit check things like armor damage/ stopping point damage   -- etc. (again this depends on your style)                            That would pretty much be it.  Friends are not necessarily the best     solution, it is a quick one, but better ways usually exist (kinda like  typing cast can be done, but avoiding them is better).                  If I remember correctly, a b-tree does not require the fact that there  is only every two children, but that order is still important...its beena long time since I have used one.                                      Thanks for the discussion.  I'll see how the game goes, and if it goes  well, then I'll see about getting a copy to you.  Right now I still havea ____lot____ of planning to do to make sure that everything fits       together!  For sure, you're not the only one who tangles themselves in  code!  I've been working on (among other projects, of course) a C seriallibrary for about two years.  You'd think that it'd be pretty impressiveby now--no way!  I've re-written it about five times because of how     tangled it's gotten!  Perhaps at some point, if I can ever finish it    properly, I could combine it with the game.  Who knows?  Perhaps I couldmake an online game out of it...  If I can survive the debug stage that is, too--debugging a serial interrupt driver on an XT is practically    impossible.  Turbo Debugger messes up the serial interrupts.  I wonder  if I should try on the 386 now?                                                                                                                 Best of luck on your projects!                                                                                                                  Andy S                                                                  Hmmm...  I can't say for sure about an _effective_ :-) algorithm to     balance a binary tree, but it does seem logical that the middle data    value (which should be at the root of the tree) could be found by       searching the tree sorting the keys into an array, and then taking the  middle value as the top.  Then you could do this for every sub-branch   (love this silly terminology!):  search the sub-branch, and the sort    the keys into an array, and then take the middle value as the root of   the sub-branch.  Do this at every Y-junction in the tree.  Does this    make sense?  I don't really know whether this is an efficient algorithm or not.  It seems a bit cumbersome.                                                                                                             Let's try to create another of my diagrams:                                                                                                     Original Tree:                                                                                                                                                          OrigMiddle                                                      /                        \                                      OrigLowValue                OrigHighValue                                                                                               1st--search _every_ value on the tree.  Get the middle one.  It becomes the new head.  In the array used to find the middle value, you also haveall the values that are lower (on one side of the array) and all the    values that are higher.  These become the data that is contained in eachmain branch of the tree.  However, you want to arrange the data in thesebranches efficiently as well, so you just take the middle value in each of these branches and make it the top of the branch.  Then you look at  each of the sub-sub-branches, and do the same, and so on until you've   reached the terminal nodes of the tree.  It should then be completely   sorted and optimized (I think!).                                                                                                                (Ignore that diagram above--it's actually quite useless! :-) )                                                                                  To build a binary tree, you'd just start with the first data item       entered as the root of the tree (for now).  The second data item enteredwould become the top of one of the two branches.  At the third data itementered, you would need to optimize the tree, because that data item    does not necessarily cause the tree to be balanced.  You could end up   with this kind of situation after the third data item:                                                                                                                          Root (Key value: Y)                                                 /                                               ta Item 2:  Key value M                                                         /                                                                 Data Item 3:  Key Value D                                                                                                                 Clearly this isn't much of a tree!  What you'd want to do is find the   middle value (M), and make it the root of the tree, using some algorithmlike the one above.  So you have:                                                                                                                                       New Root (M)                                                       /                  \                                              New Branch 1 (D)       New Branch 2 (Y)                                                                                            And that's a balanced tree.                                                                                                                     As each additional item is added, the tree is re-sorted (though,        probably to save time when the tree gets really big, you'd only want to sort after, say, every 20th data item is entered or some other          reasonable value).                                                                                                                              I've learned a lot about binary trees too just writing about this!  I   never thought much about how they worked before.  They just seemed to beanother mysterious data structure, but just thinking and hypothesizing  about them like this has shown me how they (probably) work and how they compare to other data structures!  What's next?  Linked lists?  Stacks? Queues?  Circular queues?  So many!                                                                                                             Andy S                                                                  From what I've dabbled with, DOS 5's QBasic--strange, they never once   call it QuickBASIC in the manual, or mention QuickBASIC at all--doesn't compile.                                                                                                                                        My lack of knowledge about QuickBASIC is one of my great weaknesses :-).About a year ago, I guess, I had a huge discussion with Eric Stern aboutC vs. QuickBASIC (one of those age-old "my language is better than      yours!"  "Is not"  arguments!).  About a year before that, on a         now-defunct BBS, I had yet another discussion about the same thing.  At times we'd be very civil, and at others, not quite so much!  We'd make  up huge lists of points to ask the other about his language, and create other huge lists of advantages that our language had.  We both educated ourselves somewhat, but no one was ever converted (to my knowledge--I   haven't heard from Eric in a long time--I wonder if he's still on this  BBS)!  It was fun, though.  I really wouldn't mind trying out QB        sometime when I get this game done (or possibly as a mind-resting       interlude).  Have you used it much?  What do you think of it?                                                                                   So much to do, so little time :-)!                                                                                                              Andy S                                                                  You do have a very valid point re the inability to use C++ code in C,   thus making it harder to pick up C.  I do agree with you on this.       However, it _is_ also possible to say (that poerhaps not as             convincingly) that because you can you C code in C++, that makes it     harder to make the transistion--you're not really forced to dive into   C++ as it should be, and instead cling to thoughts of C structure and   design.  It's just an idea.                                                                                                                     I've thought more about the game, and specifically in the area of       attacks.  I have more comceptual problems.  I've played games such as   D&D, so I can get very picky about this sort of thing!                                                                                          This is what seems to have to be taken into account:                                                                                            The strength of the character attacking, and his dexterity.             The type of weapon being used.                                          The dexterity of the monster (or some catch-all statistic).             The armour of the monster.                                                                                                                      So how could this be rolled up into one?                                                                                                        If you had a character.attack() function that called a weapon.attack()  function, how could you take into account the dexterity and strength of the character which affect the to-hit (dexterity) and damage (strength)?How could you make the weapon's to-hit function take into account the   monster's dexterity?  I've thought about having the whatever.attack()   function calculate (somehow) a number representing the "hit ability" of the attack, and calling a monster.doesithit(number) function to see if  the monster is hit.  This seems reasonable.  Then the monster.iswounded function could be called to wound the monster.                                                                                                  The main problem, though, is tying the character strength and dexterity into the hit and damage rolls--only it doesn't seem to work with what   seems the most logical--using a weapon.attack() function.  Perhaps the  weapon.attack function could have arguments that specifiy the bonus to  hit and damage for the character, ie.  weapon.attack(unsigned hitbonus, unsigned dmgbonus).  This seems clunky though.                                                                                                  Any suggestions?                                                                                                                                Andy S                                                                  Help!!  I used up 44 minutes of my BBS time just answering messages     today!  I'm going to have to start answering off-line it it continues   like this!                                                                                                                                      Andy S                                                                  I see where C++ really can come in handy.  That's why I decided to      use it for this game project; only I can't seem to tie all the ideas    together satisfactorily!  I agree that having constructors is a nice    feature--it is very elegant, hiding the (often messy in C, especially   for structures) task of initializing data.  You certainly do have to    think differently in C++, and knowledge of C is a hindrance in this     respect--that's probably why I'm having difficulty....                                                                                          There are so many layers involved in this project.  In C, I'd just use  functions to interpret one set of data to produce the character's screenmap, the full dungeon level, as well as the active area (which contains visible monsters, which is distinct from the _map_, which contains the  active area, but also displays the peripheral areas where monsters no   doubt are, but can't be seen).  I'm unsure of how to attempt this as    well!  Scary stuff.  But I'm going to spend a lot of time now organizingeverything.                                                                                                                                     One virtue (flaw?) of C++ is that it forces you (in theory) to plan out your project and keep it organized.  It's probably worth it to me for   that alone!                                                                                                                                     Andy S                                                                  No doubt his entire life has already been shaped by the experience. ;<) Was permament on my version.                                            Re B-trees VS binary trees.                                             I binary tree is a genetic class.  A btree structure is normaly an indexto a secondary file, and can be dynamically updated.  It is divided intonodes and leaves.  The nodes are the actual binary tree as Andy         decribed. However, there is a terminal node below, at the lowest level  of the tree.  The terminal node contains, not a record, but a record    pointer to the actual data file.  Because it is dynamic, there are      pointers both up AND down in the tree structure, and pointers laterally.Fora example, you could find the first entry in the tree, then trace thelateral pointer to scan the file in alphabetical order.  With a pure    binary tree, you can only do that by tracing up and down the tree using a stack methodology.                                                                                                                            There is also a secondary structure of a linked list within the         "standard" btree.  It contains all the unsued space in the file, so thatthe space can be re-used.  (IE all the records that have been deleted). Re trees vs sorted arrays.  You NEVER use a Btree if you can use a      sorted array.  But how do you use a sorted array with a 100 megabyte    data file?                                                              RE: back jet-packs                                                                                                                                      It goes to prove the good saying that "everything old is new    again".  Things are always being invented-some have practical uses, and some do not-which makes it difficult to determine what was invented     when, and by who.  It also makes it difficult for the average person    like you of I to become more energy efficient, when the products we needare being held back from us.

Colene Allen                    I understand you 'pickyness'.  I too have (and at times still do) playedAD&D and also Cyberpunk.                                                Firstly I would like to ask you a few personal questions, if you don't  mind.  How much experience do you have at programming, what languages,  years used etc.  Second, what areas are you interested in.  Do you have an formal training (ie at say the U of W) for programming etc?          There is a reason for these questions, but I will make you aware of it  later...                                                                Anyways ... the way I would do it is as follows:                        There is a generic person class which contains:                                 wound function                                                          to hit other function                                                   to be hit function                                                      strength variable                                                       dexterity variable                                                      weapon object                                                   From this you get your monster and your personal character.             When one goes to hit, it first calls the 'to hit other' function and    will get a rating on whether or not it hit, here bonuses are added for  strength, dexterity, and weapons (to get weapon info, we must call the  weapon functions).                                                      At that point we then call the monsters to be hit function sending in   the value that we got from the previous call.  Here the monster will    have a base for how much is required to be hit (this should be in the   generic person class).  Then depending on you, you may have a randon    role for say 'luck' which gets added to the base to be hit, then        dexterity and armour can be added to the base.                          Sorry, let me re-phrase one thing, don't send the value to the 'to be   hit', have it return the amount calculated and then you can compare the values returned from the two functions, if the defense is higher, no hit/damage occurred, if the other way then there was a hit and damage will be calculated.                                                          Since hit points are a protected variable, we call the wound function   inorder to decrease the hit points (maybe this function shouldn't be    wound, but instead hp_affector or something, so that it can be used to  increase hp's when required).                                           That is the general way I would do I think, it is using a bit from both AD&D and Cyberpunk to hit rules, but again, this can be modified to yourown personal taste.                                                     Oh, and two more final personal questions, where do you live (City (if  Cambridge .. H/P or G) ), and what 'things' have you developed so far?  Anyways ... hope this helps ... and please answer the questions.           Well good luck on your game.  The serial library sounds impressive --I've seen some books that deal with serial communications in C, and it  doesn't look like an easy task.  Seems like all programmers suffer the  turmoils of debugging; it's definitely nothing that I look forward to.  For me, my programs never seem to compile the first time (well there wasmy "Hello, World" program I wrote learning C ... :).                                                                                               I too enjoyed the discussion.  Keep at it -- perhaps on an XT, it maybe easier said than done :).                                                                                                                    .\lan                                                                      I can see the logic following your algorithm for the btrees.  It     seems very logical, but it would probably take a long time to sort if   you had to re-organize the tree every time an entry was deleted or      added.   If you only sorted the tree after 20 entries, the tree could   quite possibly degenrate quite badly.                                                                                                              I do however have a much better understanding of the concept now.  I suppose you must keep track of the total number of nodes in the tree forit to work -- sorting really doesn't take place until there are 3 items,(or more), like you mentioned.  If you balanced the tree recursively,   with a large list, you would undoubtedly use up a lot of the stack, too.There's a lot the think about when it comes to btrees.                                                                                             I've seen some books that have descriptions of the btree algorithm   that go into pages and pages of detail.  Jeez, if it's really this      complex, maybe sequential file reads aren't so bad after all :).                                                                                .\lan                                                                      Well, I have never actually seen DOS 5 refer to the BASIC included   with it as QuickBASIC either.  However, I do remember reading that it   was indeed a small-scale QuickBASIC (I can't seem to recall where).     Still, I am almost positive that you cannot create a compiled .EXE file from the DOS version of it.                                                                                                                        Although BASIC was the first programming language, I do not          particularly like it.  It was great in the days of my Commodore 64      computer when I created games as fun as watching an asterik move across the screen.  I never really liked it.  In school, I learned WATCOM      BASIC, and I became more familiar with the more advanced functions of   BASIC.  When I learned C, my interest in programming grew significantly.I am a definite supporter of C over BASIC.  I've had my own share of "MyLanguage is better than yours" arguments.  But in my mind, there's no   comparison.  I can give you lists and lists of arguments I gave, and I'msure you can do the same.                                                                                                                          Would I suggest learning BASIC?  Well, for experience sake, it's     worth a dabble or two.  But you'll be surprised at the flexibility      you'll lose.  Nahh... better stick with C :).                                                                                                   .\lan                                                                      Thanks for the explanation.  Indeed, the terms btree and binary tree seemed to be used loosely among programmers.  Since I had little        knowledge of either structure to begin with, I just went with whatever  was said.  I guess the text file I had was correct in saying that there are significant differences between the two.  Do you know where I could read more about b-trees or binary trees?  Thanks again.                                                                                         .\lan                                                                     Actually, a "random" search of a B-Tree results in a search path of   log(n) comparisons, rather than n/2 as you said (at least in a perfectlybalanced tree). You can infer from this that the larger the database,   the quicker the search will be (as compared to a sequential search).                                                                            As to the difference between a binary tree and a B-Tree (as you may haveguessed, B-tree doesn't mean binary-tree, I think I read somewhere that the-guy-who-thought-it-up's name starts with a B. (shrug)), I think theymay have meant "don't confuse a B-tree and a binary *search*, which is  of course a completely different thing. A binary search consists of     having an array of elements, all sorted properly. To start the search,  you start with the n/2'th element. Compare this against your test value.If your value is larger, the next search occurs in the "upper" half of  the array. Hmm, thats none too clear. Heres an example.                 data elements = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10                                    value to be found: 7                                                                                                                            start in the middle : compare 5 (middle element) and 7                  ok, 7's bigger. thus, we can forget about all elements under the 5      our test data now only contains: 6,7,8,9,10                             repeat the process. compare middle (8) and test (7).                    test value is smaller, reduce the test set again.                       test data is now: 6,7                                                   and so on..you get the idea.                                                                                                                    BTW, in a worst case senario (ie a completely out of balance B-tree) theB-tree is reduced to the equivilant of a linked list, giving a search   path of n/2. Thus, keeping the B-tree balanced is very important.       I wrote a set of B-tree routines a while ago in QuickBASIC. Worked      pretty well I thought. The algorithms for adding a record to the tree   are very elegant. I also improved on the whole idea by making the       structure not only a B-tree, but a linked list at the same time. Panned out very nicely for the BBS message base engine. B-tree search to a     specific message, then read the list sequentially to read forward. Neat huh?                                                                                                                                                          <Eric>                                                      Whats this I see? Andy Stedman endorsing QuickBASIC?                                                                                                Is the world ending?                                                                                                                            Am I dead?                                                                                                                                      Can this be real?                                                                                                                                     (-GRIN-)                                                                                                                               Yeah, Andy's right, QuickBASIC can be had from any dealer for about  $50. (A bargin at twice the price!) Totally awesome for the beginning   programmer. Personally, I've moved up to Microsoft BASIC PDS            (Professional Development System) 7.1. Pretty much equivilant to QB, butwith some really nice extra features. Anyways...                                                                                                        Later,                                                                                                                                              <Eric>                                                                                                                              Note to the world: I've learned Turbo Pascal! (Had to, for school.)      All I can say: Ugh. Damn semi-colons. And what kind of a language      doesn't have an exponent operator? Dumb.                                  Yeah, the version of QB with DOS 5.0 is the interpreter only. Not to  mention thats it missing other things.                                  BTW, to add to the confusion, to be completely correct, QuickBASIC is   the product that is sold (compiler) and QBASIC comes with does. Since   everyone is used to calling QuickBASIC Qbasic, this causes some         problems. (Well, its better than Gee-Whiz-BASIC. Theres rumours on that one BTW. Some say the GWBasic actually came from Gee-Whiz. Personally, ithings its initials. (Gates-William-BASIC) Go'figure.)                                                                                                    <Eric>                                                          Yeah, those are basically the methods I used. You kinda just gotta    throw the data into the tree as you get it (ie as records are added to  the DB). In a perfect world, the data would be added in such a way as tokeep the tree perfectly balanced. However, the world being the way it   is....                                                                  You have to balance it every once in a while. Once nifty idea I thought of. Have the B-tree engine keep track of the average search path over   multiple searches. If the value is too far from log(n), its time to     balance the tree. Never tried this in the real world, don't know how    effective it would be.                                                  My basic algorithm for tree-balancing.                                  1) read all the records into a array, make sure its sorted.             2) take the middle value, add it to the beginning of a new tree            (this becomes the "root" of the tree)                                3) the array is now divided into 2 parts. from the middle of each of       the 2 parts, grab a record and add it to the tree.                      (These become the first two sub-branches under the root)             4) you now have the array divided into 4 parts (kinda). pick the middle    values from these 4 parts, add them to the tree.                     5) keep going like that till you've written all the records.                                                                                    Voila. Perfect tree. However, I cringe to think how long this would takeon a large tree. But, what can ya do? All in the interest of            performance...                                                                                                                                             <Eric>                                                         Hi Andy!  Yeah, I haven't been around much. I was at University from  Sept-May last year, and haven't had much time to call around the last   couple months. And, of course, heading back to U. next month. I can't   wait really, I MISS the university computer networks. I found things    there you just wouldn't belive! Once ya get a taste of the real world,  ya just don't really want to go back to plain old BBS's. But, the small town BBS's do have a much more personal feel, which is nice. (Not to    mention color!)                                                                                                                                            <Eric>                                                                                                                               (Picture this in a real small font - "QuickBASIC rules!")  (grin!)         Andy,                                                                                                                                           Check the programmers file area for FIGHT.ZIP. It contains some C    source code for fight routines like those you were talking about. I     pulled them out of a much larger program (over 300k compiled), so just  muddle through them. Hope it helps. I've got similar code from another  similar program, but it'll take me longer to find that. I'll get back toya. Gotta go.                                                                                                                                          <Eric>                                                           Hey Alan, I ordered the upgrade a little while ago (should get it soon  as they called to ask what disk size I wanted a couple of weeks ago).   Anyhow here's the deal.  If you purchased BC3.0 after April 1 this year (as I did) then the upgrade is free (while $10 for shipping).  If not   then it's $35 (I think, very close to that anyways) which is still a    great deal.  Oh yeah I'm talking about BC plus the app frameworks which is what I gather you have.  So give em a call soon.  If you need the    number for the canadian office let me know and I can get it to you.

[Continued in next message; I'm nearly out of room!!]                   Next topic:  Fighting.  I read (and I think!) digested your outline.    I'll get back to you re implementing it.  There is one thing that I'm   not sure if I want to do, and that is "ask the weapon for its bonuses". It seems to me that that would be something that the character would    never know--even though it's not displayed on the screen--so the weapon should never return its bonuses to anything.  I've worked through what Iwant to have in the generic player character structure (but not yet the final monster one, and not yet their common ancestor), and it is        something like this (most of the member functions have not yet been     worked out yet!!):                                                                                                                              class character : public organism       // or something!                {                                                                               status          hp;             // status is a special class            status          ac;                                                     unsigned        infravision_dist;       // 0 = none                                                                                             attribute       strength;       // attribute is a special class         attribute       dexterity;                                              attribute       constitution;                                           attribute       intelligence;                                           attribute       perceptiveness;                                         attribute       personal_charm; // need a better phrase?

Status's cannot.  I   thought it'd be interested if you never actually knew what your         attributes/skills/status's were:  each class has a describe() function  that returns a string instead to describe the attribute/status/skill on a scale of:                                                                                                                                     Abyssmal--Pathetic--Very Poor--Low--Below Average--Average--Above               Average--High--Exceptional--Superb--Tremendous--Phenomenal                                                                              Enough of 'em!

You never get programs to compile the first time, either?  I've had     problems with programs the size of "Hello, world"!  :-)  It's           embarassing....                                                                                                                                 I won't have to keep clunking away on an XT anymore, though.  I picked  up a 386-40 last week, and I'm hoping that it'll do me for a while.  By the time I get a newer one, for sure it'll seem like an XT!

I've never had to use a B-tree in a   program yet.  It's scary how much there is to consider...

Eric Stern wrote to me in message 1406 (I'm doing all this reading offline because I got _9_ messages today, a definite personal   record!), and it seems that I looked too weak when writing to you re    BASIC.  I've capitulated!  :-).  Perhaps you can fend him off while I   regain my footing!  He uses a function library whose name I've finally  forgotten that replaces QuickBASIC's and makes it vastly more           efficient--and even comparable with C's (to some extent).  I'll have to pull out my pointer argument again if this starts all over... if I can  remember it!                                                                                                                                    It _is_ awfully hard to argue when you don't know the fullest extents ofyour opponent's language, though--the most experience I've had is with  GW-BASIC in this realm.

The whole problem is that is _was_ real!  You weren't _supposed_ to readthat!  You aren't _supposed_ to know how I really think!                                                                                        {:.....  sigh  .....:}                                                                                                                          At least you have a bit higher profile than before.  You're not still   functioning at the "beginner's"-level QB.  Now you can say in a haughty,nasal voice, peering down your nose at others, "Do _you_ program in     Microsoft's Beginner's** All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code          Professional Development System?  _I_ do...!"                                                                                                   **problem word here (Beginner's)                                                                                                                Without the beginner's, I suppose, it would sound better; but it's      pretty impressive sounding the way it is.  The beginner's _does_ clash  oddly with the professional!                                                                                                                    You learned Pascal????

Let's see how much you remember, On what day and time did you first     speak.                                                                     Though I am sure that you are correct, how is it that a search path  of a b-tree yields log(n) comparisons rather than n/2?  I can't seem to follow how finding the natural logarithm relates (you do mean log, and  not log10, right?).                                                                                                                                You could be correct in thinking that the confusion was over a b-treevs a binary search, but the text I was referring to clearly refers to itas b-tree vs. binary tree.  Oddly enough, the only thing said about it  was that b-trees were more complex and involved that binary trees.  All the same, I think I'll stick with the simplest ideas for now :).                                                                                   I also read that in a completely unbalanced tree, it is degenerated  into a linked list.  Again, the text I was reading provides the "AVL"   algorithm for balancing a tree -- it seems quite logical and            easy-to-follow.  Your program in QuickBASIC sounds quite excellent.  Youmentioned that adding entries to the list were very elegant, but were   you able to make an equally impressive routine for deleting entries?    That also seems to be something to think about...                                                                                               .\lan                                                                      Hi Sean,                                                                                                                                          I purchased BC++ v3.0 and the application frameworks, but          separately (i.e. not the combo package).  Does the free upgrade to 3.1  still apply to that?  I called the Canadian Borland support twice, but  both times I called outside regular office-hours and got an answering   machine type thing.  Since then, I seemed to have misplaced the #.  Can you please leave the number here?  Thanks.                                                                                                      .\lan                                                                      Well, good luck all the same with the serial library.  Sounds        difficult; you'd probably have to do a lot of BIOS stuff (int86()       calls?).  Definitely more into the advanced stuff of C.                                                                                            You had problems with "Hello, World!"?  Don't worry about it -- I    couldn't compile my first C++ program that did that in windows (and all I did was make a few changes to the DEMO program provided! :).  I'm surethe 386-40 is more than sufficient and will last you a while.  Let me   know when you finish some, or any of your programs (if at all).  I'd    love to see them!                                                                                                                               .\lan                                                                      Well you've hit right on the money with pointers.  You know this as  well as I do, so what I'm about to write is probably redundant.  Becausepointers are very similar to the way the machine itself operates, they  are very efficient.  You can argue for the longest time about pointers  -- it's the main thing that separates C from other languages.                                                                                     I too, have heard of QuickBASIC utilities that make code smaller and  more efficient.  Still, it's not C.  And my favourite argument is that  BASIC is exactly what the name implies -- it's basic!  The name itself  is an acronym for "Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code".                                                                           .\lan                                                                   Hi Andy,                                                                I am using Qbasic that comes with Dos5. I can't find Microsoft QB4.5    compiler at any store. Maybe I havent found the right store yet. Thanks.Well, I think that a small portion should be changed.  You derived      character from the organism class, but you have to realize that some of the aspects listed in character do in fact belong to organism.  For     example hp, infravision(for that matter ultraviolet) etc.  As well, I   would change the idea about weapontry.  I would have the things a       charcter can carry in a linked list of some kind so that he can carry   more (if able), but may can switch to others if he has them (have       something point to which weapons are wielded. As for weapon bonuses, I  think it is nothing to worry about when considering the characters      knowledge of it.  First of all, it may be possible for an identify spellto tell the character, second, since it is being say returned from a    call, the user of your program can still never see it, unless you       implement it that way, third just keep it protected so that it can't be changed, that is the biggest concern.                                   Well, I can't really talk right now, but I will get back to you.        Gee..I think it was a Thursday at 9:27 in the morning...anything else   that you must know or do you have a book of stupid questions to         ask..come on there has to be something of m,ore substance that we can betalking about...like ...I don't know ..uumm inflation...crime....or --- Actually, I believe that fast search (though it was broken by some guy  who works on MicroSoft's FoxPro database package) is theoretically is   nlog(n)...                                                              I've read a number of messages regarding Binary trees and B-trees.  If  you're interested, I could perhaps enlighten as to a few related topics.I can describe algorithms and derivations for Binary trees, red/black   trees (dynamically balanced binary trees), B-trees (which no one has yetaccurately described), and other searching methods (hashing, etc.) of   interest.  I don't have much time now and I don't know if interest is   still there, but, if it is, drop me a note and I'll explain as required.

Well, better for you with jason Lives, i felt more like I had been      stoned by medusa !                                                         I dunno why the search path solves to log(n). Whaddya think I am,    a theoretical data structure mathematician? I picked up an article      somewhere on B-trees & data structures, thats where I got the info.     (And the basic info that let me write my B-tree engine.)                I *think* that possibly:                                                - a binary tree only has "leaves" in the structure                      - a B-tree is a binary tree and linked list all in one                                                                                            That would make sense, since your article said that B-tree's were morecomplex than binary trees. (Shrug). I get to the point where I have to  say, "Who cares? Use what works.".                                                                                                              I dunno if I ever finished the delete routines for the B-tree in basic. (Which, BTW, I named "QB-Tree". Clever eh?) If I didn't, its not too    much work. As Donald Tee's suggested, you simply extract the record fromthe current tree by adjusting all the pointers that go from and to that record to "skip over it". Then, add that record position to the deleted record list. I think Donald suggested having a seperate tree in the filefor the deleted records, but I think a linked list is all that is neededin that case. With this method of course, when you add a new record to  the file, you should check the deleted list first, and overwrite one of the deleted records before you add a new one.                                                                                                                                                                                      <Eric.                                                                                                                               ---                                                                      MaxReader 1.30 - Whip me, beat me, make me code in C...

Justask them to order it for you, it shouldn't take more than a few days.

What a drag                Ya, I tried it, I know it sounds like I'm stoopid but I'm not an idiot. I think I'll try taking out my fax/modem card and try again.            Well I guess I really should update my messages, I figured out ENABLE,  and took the advice of many, I got TELIX. But my latest problem is that Telix wont reconize that my modem is on comm port #2, maybe its because its a FAX/MODEM card and Telix doesn't know what to do. Or maybe yet    again its because I havent config.'ed it right, I'm not sure if my    modem is a modem with "Switchs" or not, what the hell are switchs       anyway? If your thinking of suggest that I try pressing ALT P or re     configing, I already have.                                                Hey Alan, to tell you the truth I don't know about the upgrade with   respect to buying the frameworks seperately but I would think that if   you bought both of them after april 1, 1992 then they should be free butdon't ask me, ask them.  The number in Canada is (800)-461-3327.  That'sthe customer service place.  They were really nice about it all when I  called but that was about 2 months ago.  I still haven't got the upgradethough they called here about 3-4 weeks ago to ask what disk size I     wanted so I don't know what the delay is.  I may call them tommorow to  ask.

In England, you may well be able to go one end of the conuntry to the other on one charge, since it is asmall country.

Small town??  I'm originally from P.E.I. [eleven years ago] which now has a total population of about     130,000!!) BBS's have a lot of colour (especially this one), and a more personal feel, but many of them, in my opinion, also have a boring feel.It doesn't seem that many people are interested in writing mail (at     least on the BBS's I've seen, unless there's a _huge_ echo set up, no   one's interested in writing messages or discussing programming or       anything else).  And the file areas are either extremely small or filledwith pathetic stuff.  You can't win.

BTW, what are _you_ doing with C code?  :-)  And what program, just out of                                                                      curiosity, did you pull it out of?                                                                                                              You're slipping; you're slipping...

The reason is   that the bios functions (don't even ask about the DOS functions) for    serial interrupt-driven (the most efficient method) I/O are absolutely  pathetic!                                                                       (In other words, you have to deal with the hardware directly in most cases.  It's  more fun that way anyway!)                                                                                                   I'll let you know if I manage to finish any of my programs!                                                                                     Thanks for the chat.........                                                                                                                    Andy S                                                                  You're right--I've used the same argument numerous times, re pointers   being low-level and thus very efficient.  However, it didn't really win any converts!  The "opposition" used the point that QuickBASIC is not   the BASIC that everyone else knows--it's now structured (in a very      similar way to C), with procedures (functions... whatever).                                                                                     Andy S                                                                  If you really can't find anywhere that sells it off the shelf, I'm sure that some place would order it for you if you asked.  It is (to my      knowledge) a very popular software product.  Keep looking and good luck!                                                                        Andy S                                                                  I'm (in some ways) a step ahead of you!  I already moved such things as infravision, hp, etc. into the "living" class (as I now call it), among others--resistances, carried, etc.                                                                                                              Perhaps I'd better explain better how the weapons were going to work:   only two places in an array were allocated for _wielded_ weapons, not   carried weapons.  At most, characters are only allowed to wield (ie. usein combat) two weapons.  They may carry any number (up to a defined     maximum weight/encumbrance) using the carried object (eg. in a backpack,strapped somewhere, in a boot, etc.).                                                                                                           I still haven't completely decided how to implement attacking.  Thinkingabout this topic has also brought up the problem of thrown weapons and  missile weapons... but that's another story!                                                                                                    Andy S                                                                  Most modems have either (or both) a small box on the surface of the     circuit board that has tiny switches on it (used for configuring such   things as what port the modem should be located at), and jumper pins    (which have removable covers that can be placed on different sets of    pins to set similar information).  This is all for an internal modem.   How did you configure your modem to be COM2?                                                                                                    Andy S                                                                  Petersburg, you must have been at the Blue Moon first and then over to  the Park.  I hope the train that runs right beside there didn't disturb you.                                                                    re: Petersburg                                                                                                                                          Actually, I have never been to the Blue Moon, and the train     didn't disturb me because I grew up in Petersburg, and had to listen to that train every day and night for fourteen years.  My maiden name is   Evans, and we lived in the cul de sac on Alice Cr.  My dad was a teacherat W.O. for many years, and then transfered to Glenview.  He retired twoyears ago, and I have not been to Petersburg since 1988.                                                                                                                                          Colene Allen          hE                                                                      Hey folks here ya go.....                                               .                                                                                      One day the pope was looking out upon the Vatican garden admiring the lovly landscape work and suddenly decided to go out for a  walk.  After strolling around the gardens for a while he began to feel astrange sensation in his loins.  Looking around to see that no one was  looking he quitely hiked up his skirt and began to indulge in some solo sex.  After hewas finished he looked around and then went back          inside....                                                                           Two weeks later the pope was sitting at his desk doing     whatever it is the pope does when he recieved a message fom his         secretary.."Hey John, there is someone here from Time Life to see you." "Send him in.", the pope said...  In walked the reporter. "Pope, I have something I think you'll be interesed in here."  The man threw a        package of photos onto the popes desk.  After looking at the pictures   the Pope simply placed them back down and said "How much do you want?"  "$10,000 please.  Then you can have the photos and the negatives, even  the camera.." Realizing his predicament the pope reached into the drawerbeside hime and got out a stack of crisp bills, he paid the reporter andtold him to leave....                                                                   A week later the pope was sitting in his office feeling bored when he say the camera sitting on the shelf right where he had    left it.  He grabbed it, put it over his neck and went outside.  After  taking several photos of the fine foliage he noticed some poeple staringat him from a short distance away.  being a social person the pope wavedthem over for a chat.  "Oh, Mr. Pope we are so glad to see              you...blah,blah,blah......"The pope simple nodded alot and smiled at thechildren. then a man in the group said  "excuse me, I had no idea you   enjoyed photograhy where did you get that camera."  "Oh, I just bought  it a week ago."  "Really"said the man, "and how much was that camera it sure is nice." "$10,00 dollars said the pope." The man simply shook his head and said "Wow, someone must have seen you coming...."              HAHAHAHAHA.....                                                         get it .....  coming....cumming....hahahahaha...                        Nobody...???? that's too bad....                                        Okay whatever you say my friend ...I guess we will just wait and see... NO I don't think sooo it wasn't that good...Medusa is much better and   younger than myself...you would have been better off with her....         It would be able to go at least several hundred miles before needing  to be recharged.  There are places where an electric car would not be   practical therefore.  But 90% of North Americans do not live or drive   in them.                                                                  I would suggest you brush up on your history.  From the time of the   guilds and the hansa (and of course, way before), those selling productsand services have attempted to control the market and eliminate         competition.  From fruit companies forcing peasants off their land      to gas companies price fixing, major companies have ruthlessly          attempted, and usually succeeded, in squeezing out the smaller          companies.                                                                 The middle ages was more sensible than the present in at least       one respect.  They had a law which prohibited making an unfair or       unrealistic profit on any item.                                            I certainly made no claim that these major companies control the     world.  They are not so intelligent as all that.                        We also have laws prohibiting unfair or unrealistic profits arising fromillegitimatemonopolies (since monopolies are carefully      regulated) and laws preventing monopolies from being set up without     government approval (in the U.S., I believe it's called the Combines    Investifgation Act).                                                                                                                           The electI sufggest you check your engineering.  Electric carshave never been abele to be usefully large and have a cruising range ofhundred s of miles doue to the weight of the lead-acid battery        technology that thehas been in use.  The battery ies just don't    hold the power for their weight that twould be needed to make the thingdo what you suggest.  The nevwer sodium-sulphur batteries do have the  power-to-weight ratio, but are not in production anywhere in the world  that I have heard of, and at last I heard aren't yet in a production    form yet.                                                               Well if your Dad was a teacher at W-O then your Dad's name is Ron Evans.Your Dad would be a lot shorter than he is if he knew that you where    making love beside the railway tracks.    What year did you graduate    from W-O   It's a small world.                                          As a matter of fact I was just thinking.  Your Dad hasn't been hitting  any more dear with his truck has he?                                    Why don't blind people sky dive?                                        It's to hard on their dogs.                                             I heard that Evil is coming out of retirement.   He is going to dress upas an altar boy and try running across Newfoundland!!!!!!!              L. A. has a new slogan for their tourist trade.    Come to Los Angelos  we will treat you like a   KING                                         you can lead a horse to water........ but who gives a damn if you don't have a horse.                                                           Well what do you think about bush trying trying to start a war          somewhere to up his popularity.  He keeps saying that the United states will have to step in and help in the Yugoslavian, Croation (I doubt thatis the correct spelling) war.  And he also Keeps saying he should step  in in Iraq.  To me this is utterly stupid and the man should be shot.   And just to make matters worse I heard today on the Radio that Mulroney has said he will give support to the U.S. if they need it.              What do you think?                                                      P.S.  if you don't like this topic CHANGE IT!!!                         Well what the hell can you say but that get rid of Bush ...he is nothingbut an idiot...and good old Mulroney..well something should be done     about him too...anyway...I am really not a big political type because   all our politicians as far as I am concerned are idiots...              New Topic...mmmmm lets find something that everyone likes...sex is      always a good topic...any comments ???                                  re: graduate from W.O.                                                                                                                                  Actually, I never went to W.O.  I graduated in 1987 from        Southwood S.S. in Cambridge.  I started high school the year that my dadtransfered, which means that we moved.  My parents live in Roseville    now, and I had my fun at the park when I went back to Petersburg to     visit, after I had moved out of home.                                                                                                                   As for Ron Evans, he is my dad, and not only is he short, but hewas also very old fashioned.  He's a grandfather now, and in his late   fifties.  Retirement has been good for him, as he can now go fishing    whenever he wants, and not have to worry about working.                                                                                                 Do you know Mr. Allen, the librarian? He's my father-in-law.  I married his son.  If the name doesn't ring a bell, then you were there  after he left.  My mother-in-law was a seceratary at W.O. as well.                                                                                                                              Colene Allen            re: dear                                                                                                                                                                SAY WHAT????                                                                                                                                                            Colene Allen            Dear Andy S, I guess the main prob is that I'm acttually using my       parents system, until I can save enough cash to get one to call my own. Thats where the problem starts, in the first place there very slow when it cooms to getting this done and consequently get angry when I ask if Ican help them, hell I didn't even see them put the board in. So I have  really no idea what they've done. Mybe when they go awy I'll have to popthe cover and see what the hells going on. Later                        Your father-in-law is Dave Allen.  He sure is a lot taller than your    Dad.  If I remember right Dave was a consultant after he left W-O.  I   already knew that your Dad lived in Roseville.  I had both your Father  and Father-in-law for teachers but that was probably before you where   born, in about 1964 or 1965.  I was talking to your Dad the summer that he retired and that is how I knew that he had hit a deer with his truck.If I remember right your father-in-law had a nick name of stretch       because of his height.                                                     Any good textbook on data structures should have binary tree stuff init.  As for Btrees, the best is probably to read some code.  If you download the source for Binkley from a some board (kw radio has it), the    nodelist (version 7) os a btree structure.  The code is a bit of a pig  to read, but then all C code is.                                        My youngest is 15, my oldest 22.  They are beyond breast feeding <G>    (maybe old enough to get back to it).  But they were both breast feed   when young.  I always felt that bottles, etc., were rather silly when   nature gave a perfectly good supply with a minimum of bother.           Actually, the way it is really done is as follows.  You build your tree dynamically, but the terminal leaf node is created as a linked list.    That allows sequential in order tracing of the tree at any time.  To do a reorganization, you trace the terminal node linked list.  As it is, ineffect, a sorted file, you can build a classic balanced tree relatively easily.                                                                     I did indeed hear that it was a bad idea to criticize BASIC over C  where you're around :).  About _readable_ code, you can make C code     quite readable as well.  Granted that you will have to have a basic     understanding of C to understand readable C code, that's true for all   languages.                                                                                                                                          I'm sure you can whip up TSR programs in C in 5 minutes too.  Of    course, you'd be using someone's library (like TesSeract or whatever -- the makers of TCXL).  Wouldn't you have to do the same in BASIC (i.e.   use a library?).                                                                                                                                   Anyways, I'd prefer :                                                                                                                        void main(void)                                                         {                                                                          printf("Hello World!\n");                                            }                                                                                                                                               over                                                                                                                                            print "Hello World!"                                                                                                                               anyday ... but that's just me :).                                                                                                            .\lan                                                                      What about the actual compiled code of BASIC vs. C?  I know that     there are utilities to generate compact QB executable code, but is it asgood as C? (i.e. is it as small and does it run as fast?).  That I'm notsure about, but I would think that C is still better in these areas.                                                                              I dunno ... these arguments can go on forever (if you're debating withthe right people).  Maybe we should leave it before the whole message   base is filled with C vs. BASIC! :)                                                                                                             .\lan                                                                       Thanks for the information, Donald.  I've been looking through some books that do have information on binary trees, and I'm debating which  one I should buy.  All-in-all, it seems like something very useful and  worth learning.                                                                                                                                    I'll check out the Binkley source code and see if I can understand it(probably not, but why not try? :).                                                                                                             .\lan                                                                       Whether it's log(n), or n/2, you're right -- who cares?  All that   you really need to know is that it's efficient, I guess.  I'm sure      binary trees aren't as difficult as I think they are right now, but I   guess I need to see more code before I get a better feel for it.                                                                                    You wouldn't happen to have an C code for binary trees would you?   The closest thing I have (that's explained, at least) is written in C++.Anyways, thanks for the info.                                                                                                                   .\lan                                                                     Hi Jim!                                                                                                                                          I've been getting a lot of responses about binary trees, and b-trees,and I think the information is starting to come together.  The ideas youmentioned in your message sound interesting.  Although I think that     experimenting is the best thing for me to do to learn binary tress rightnow, I'd be interesting in hearing about "red/black" trees, and the     "hashing" you mentioned.  I'm sure they're both very complex topics, butall I really want to know is what they are, so I have a feel for it.    Perhaps, you could also give us all a definitive answer on what the     difference between the binary tree and b-tree is.                                                                                               .\lan                                                                   i have tried emm36  but it will not work as i have a 286 any other      suggestions                                                                     Yup.  That's my father-in-law.  I am surprised to find someone  who knows them.  It's been a long time since they taught at W.O.  As formy dad hitting a dear, I didn't know about that at all.  I shall have tocall him and ask about it.  I don't see my family much because they are quite busy and I am also very busy.  We get together ocassionally, and  it's nice to have something to kid my dad about.  Thanx a lot for the   creative influencing material.

I am very pleased to know that you believe in breast-feeding.  On to other things, is there a way to tell your kids   about sex without them thinking you are giving them permission to go    ahead and do it.                                                                                                                                                                                Colene Allen             The laws to prosecute monopolies are very weak.  Monopolies obviously  exist, in many different business and industrial areas.  There have beenmany cases of price fixing but the meager fines imposed upon conviction are not very discouraging to business.                                     There are no laws regulating the amount or percentage of profits (at least, not that I know of) that a company can make, in most areas of    business.                                                                  Facts on electric cars are hard to come by.  I just quoted what I    heard, but will try and make time to see what info I can dig up at      the local library.                                                         By the way, do you know anything about bankruptcy laws?              Specifically, is there a time limit, such as 10 years before a company  can go back in business after declaring bankruptcy?

As shown, operations on a binary tree are fairly simple (if you do      have trouble following the algorithms, work them out on paper with      an example tree).  If you have any questions, please ask.                                                                                       Since all the operations depend on the height of the tree, we can       proceed to examine ways of trying to maintain the tree at its optimal   height for a given set of nodes.  In a couple of days, I'll upload an   extension of binary trees (called red-black trees) that are             dynamically balanced and solve the height optimization problem.                                                                                 If anyone would like sample C code, I will provide some as well.

Only teasing maybe, so what can an old foggie like yourself tell me.    Thank you.. Geez I thought that most ofthe people here are anti-OS/2. I have a 386/40 with 8 megs ram. and it smokes windows,MS DOS,DR DOS, and all other operating systems that I have used (except UNIX.. but who     wants that <G> ) What I would like to see is an operating system that   treats everything as an object. Object oriented code is the way to go   definately. It is more much more efficient.

They have both graduated and this will be my daughters second year of   teaching herself.  Damn school teachers, my wife is one and when ever I don't do it right she makes me do it over again.                        Jesus's last word to the Newfies  "Play dumn till I get back"           A lady that had just turned 40 was down in the dumps about her age and  had been feeling depressed.  She made an appointment with her doctor fora check up.   The doctor checked her over and said she was in excellent shape and she should be proud that she was in such good shape because   she had the body of a 20 year old.  The doctor said look at your breaststhey are as firm as any 20 year old and your tummy is just as flat and  firm as a 20 year old.  He told her when ever you get depressed about   your age just look in the mirror and tell yourself this and I am sure   you will feel better.                                                   That evening she stood in front of the mirror and looked at herself and turned from side to side and said "you look great you have the breasts  of a twenty year old, you have the tummy of a 20 year old."  just then  her husband put his paper down and ask his wife what the doctor had to  say about her 40 year old ass.  His wife looked at him and said "your   name wasn't brought up at all"                                                                                                                          did you know that the newfies are hoping that Quebec will       seperate so that the trip homw will be shorter?

Well I'm quite interested in OS/2 -- when I saw a demo of it, I was  quite impressed.  The only thing I don't like is the WPS (I really don'tcare much for GUIs).  I've never used Dr. DOS, but I haven't heard the  greatest things about it.                                                                                                                          About object-oriented code -- indeed it does seem to be getting more and more popular.  I'm starting to learn C++ right now, but I've had a  taste of OOP doing some other programming.  Now I can't decide whether  or not to further my C knowledge first... there are some things about   OOP that I don't really like.  The main thing I don't like is the idea  of having sections of code all over the place.  It makes it hard to keeptrack of (at least in the language I was using before).  I hope C++     isn't like that.                                                                                                                                 .\lan                                                                     Sorry, but I was reading through the last section of messages, and I couldn't help but to start thinking about C programming.  I think it    might be the subliminal messages I'm c-ing on my screen :).

I can follow  the logic behind it, but if you don't mind, would you be able to        demonstrate the equivalent C code?  I'd just like to see how the        algorithm could be written with structures and pointers.  Thanks in     advance.                                                                                                                                        .\lan                                                                      Hi everyone,                                                                                                                                     I just have a quick question for all you technical wizards out      there.  I've been doing a lot of reading lately involving relatively    advanced C functions and I'm coming across a lot of information about   the stack and the heap.  My question is : What the heck are these thingsexactly?!  The only information I have in all of my texts say that they are areas in memory; the stack being an area which holds temporary      infomration like parameters in a function call.  Can anyone help me out?Thanks.                                                                                                                                         .\lan                                                                   In my haste yesterday, I neglected to proof read closely enough the     pseudo code I uploaded regarding binary trees.

Anyhow, that won't be for a while... I have to master the regular C     first <G>....                                                              Yeah, I'm doing the same; I was talking to a lot of people who also  recommended learning C thoroughly before learning C++.  Unfortunately, Ialso hear that you will have to "unlearn" some things about C when you  start C++.                                                                                                                                      .\lan                                                                   Funny you should mention ice cubes, one of the most erotic encounters I ever had was with my girlfriend at the time. I cautiously allowed her totie me too the bed and then she blew my "mind" with alternating crushed ice and hot oil. Never quite experienced anything like it before or     since!                                                                  I finally found Microsoft quick basic at Cambridge computers.

Colene Allen            Yes I did hear it would be a short trip.   The Air Canada flight is     leaving for St. Johns when the big hand is at the twelve and the little hand is at the four.                                                    My wife told me the other day what God said when he finished greating   man.    "I can do better than that"                                     My wife is a teacher which isn't that bad, if I don't do it right the   first time she makes me do it over again.                               Hmmm, it seems that there is no further interest in tree structures, andafter I spent all that time.... Oh, well, any other topics of interest?

I wonder if that killed any C vs. QB argument that could have started?  I haven't checked out the rest of the base yet...  I do think, though, that the compiled code of QB is quite good          (comparable with, say, BC++ 2.0 or lower), but not a match for an       optimizing compiler...

PDQ's       data manager doesn't move things around in the data area like MS-BASIC  does. (Thats why they couldn't use pointers, the data it was pointing atcould move at any time.) However, you'd have to re-write the compiler   to do that.                                                                                                                                     I could do a linked list type deal right now, using an array to hold thememory pointers to the data. Works the same as pointers, different      method.                                                                                                                                         Maybe MS will implement pointers in the next version of BASIC.          (Ya right. MS ain't that bright.)                                                                                                                                     <Eric>                                             I pulled the code from LPMUD/PC. I picked it up at university.         Its one of the best parts of the network, real-time (kinda) online      multi-user roleplaying. (MUD = Multi User Dungeon)                      They have software that uses a huge database to store information about the virtual world. Its almost like a huge text adventure. (Ie You go    east and see a castle, with entrance to the north. You see Bob here).   At his point, you could enter the castle, go elsewhere, talk to Bob,    etc. Bob could be a robot (computer run) or another player connected to the system in, say, Germany.                                                                                                                      I think you get the idea. Anyways, its wicked and I miss it.                                                                                                   <Eric>                                                   Well, I've got some advertising that says PDQ programs compiled size  and execution speed will kick TC. But, that is advertising.                                                                                      On the average, a similar C and QB/PDQ program, the C will probably    come out smaller. But, the question is, how much smaller?  If the BASIC program comes out to 10k, while your C program is 9k, well, you win.    But what the hell do I care about *1k* on my 176meg drive?              What I'm saying: Yeah, C'll probably be smaller, but not                *signifigantly* smaller (or faster).                                                                                                            BTW, if I push things, I can pop out the program:                       PRINT "Hello, World!"                                                     to be a 668 byte EXE.  Try it in C and let us know.                                                                                           (Well, its around 668 bytes. I don't recall the exact number, it was 2  years ago.)                                                                                                                                                          <Eric>                                               Sorry, no B-trees in C. I've got tons of C code around, but for other things. I use it for research. The results are usually minimal.

That's pretty impressive --    I wasn't aware that it could come close to even older C compilers.      Still, I think that if the QB vs. C argument is still around, the C sidestill has more strength.                                                                                                                        .\lan                                                                       I'm sure that the advertising of "kicking TC" is rather blown up.   Precisely what version of TC were they talking about?  Also, as Andy    mentioned, I'm sure optimizing compilers will generate smaller, perhaps faster (probably faster) than QB code.                                                                                                              Your "hello.c / hello.bas" program really isn't a fair example.  Of course, there's no comparison -- BASIC will obviously generate smaller  compiled code.  But we're talking about _useful_ code.  By the time the source code gets bigger, the advantage of using C will obviously shine  through.  Still, I'll have to say, that 688 bytes or whatever is really quite impressive.                                                                                                                               .\lan                                                                                                                                              Actually, could you describe the difference between a binary tree anda btree?  I'm still unsure on how they are different.  The information  you left on binary trees is quite good, but I'm still sorting through   all the information I have so I can try my own coding with it.  By that time, I'm sure I'll have plenty of questions for everyone :).                                                                                   .\lan                                                                   Well, I am not sure that I am the right person to ask about that.  I    have never really felt that there was anything wrong with sex.          I think that it is important to teach children that sexual              realationships, at least at their best, involve an emotional            relationship that should not be taken lightly.  I also believe that it  is important to teach them practical information on protecting          themselves from danger (both medical and emotional).                        As for teaching them to stay away from sex, though, I think that is rather silly and futile.  Better to teach them to enjoy it rather than  be dominated by it, and to teach them how to relate to people on a      multiple level basis, rather than on a strictly sexual basis.                   I am very pleased to see that you have such a liberal attitude  towards sex.  I was asking because, when my son turns thirteen, I will  have to teach him about sex, but I don't want him to decide at that     point that it would be a good time to try it out.  I would like to thinkthat I can teach him about sex in such a way that he will understand    that it is something that is important in his life, but not something   that he needs to try out right away, or in the near future.                                                                                             As you are a more experienced parent than myself, I thought thatmaybe you could make some suggestions on how one would approach the     topic with seeming like they are saying " Go out and do it now, but     don't get anyone pregnant, or catch AIDS."  I want to be able to        communicate with my son that sex is fine, but not when you aren't ready for it, and not when you are legally underage.                                                                                                                                                  Colene Allen            Well, I'll be getting BC++ V3.0 shortly, I think that I'll upgrade to   3.1 right away. I know that I will have to un-learn a few things for    C++, but they are mostly little shortcuts that I have found that gets   the job done with less code. The C++ compiler is really amasing(sp) It  catches almost every mistake.. I don't think that I am going to enjoy   trying to install V3.0.. I heard that it takes 45Meg. (Maybe I'll look  for a CD ROM Version.. I really need another HDD I've only got 130M, and21M free.. <Grin>                                                                                                                               Oh well...

I don't know if this is their upgrade policy for allupgrades, or just if you purchase the application frameworks and BC++   separately.  Actually, I think that BC++ is still at 3.0, the only thingthat has gone to 3.1 is the application frameworks (correct me if I'm   wrong).  All you get with the upgrade is disks and a small book         describing the changes.  I dunno, I'll let you know for sure if/when I  finally get around to mailing a cheque.                                                                                                         .\lan                                                                   Colene, if you are planning to wait until your son is 13 you may be to  late.  Not that he may have already tried it, however he is going to    have a lot of information about sex by the time he reaches 13.  My wife and myself took a course this past winter on how to talk to teenagers   and the instructors for that course said that the average age for kids  to have sexual intercourse the first time in inter city schools is 12   years 3 months.  I can tell you that I just about fell through the floorwhen I heard those figures because I have a daughter that is just about 13 and a son who is going to be 9 in Sept.                              I have two older kids a daughter that has been married for over 5 years and from what I can gather she was still a virgin until about 6 or 8    months before she got married (think so anyways).  I also have a son    that is 23 and I think he may have been a bit younger than his sister   from what I understand he had just turned 18.  I have a pretty open     relationship with my kids so I think the information is fairly accurate.I just hope that the two younger ones will do as well and wait till theyare mature enough to handle that kind of relationship.   I think it madea difference that the two older ones grew up in a small town and went toa good high school (W.O.).  I am bringing up my two youngest in the cityand we are in a good area however the violence has increased a lot sincemy two oldest ones grew up and the availability of drugs has increased alot.   I think that the best we can do is love our kids a lot and spend time with them and show an interest in their lives, hopefully by        teaching them to be responsible individuals they will make the right    choices.   They have to make them we can't.                             Well, the only thing that I can suggest is to tell the truth ... explainexactly how you feel and why, as best you can.  My experience with      children is that they will try out sex when they are ready; there is    nothing that you can really do or say that will affect that a lot.  Whatyou say will affect something else entirely: it will affect what they dowhen they are uncertain and who they will come to for advice.              If you teach a child well, your teachings on responsability, love,   and persoanal relationships will affect all their relationships, sexual or otherwise.  That is about all that you can ask for.                     Hopefully, they will also understand that you are non-judgemental to the extent that they can trust you to come and ask you for advice.  Thatis just not going to happen if you are unrealistic.                        Let me give you and example from another area.  My 15 year old knows that I seldom drink, and would not be very happy to have her come home  drunk.  Yet last week when a bunch of them were at a party and the      driver got a bit pissed, she phoned me to get them home.  She knows thatregardless of my feelings I'd get in the car, deliver every one of the  crowd home, and keep my mouth shut. (which I did). The fact is that I   would be silly to bitch, and quite prefer a pain in the ass trip to a   car full of dead kids.                                                     I think that you have to consider sex in somewhat the same light. It is one thing to attempt to impose out own value systems on a child; it  is quite another to foster a pregnamcy on one because they are afraid toask for birth control.                                                     As for the age 13 ... if you wait that long you will not have to     bother with sex education.  Start teaching at 5.`                          My children go to O/W.  I can assure you for a fact that there are   few sexually inexperienced children there past grade 10.  There are manymany more that keep there parents unaware than there are that keep theirsexual knowledge unaware.                                                  These are farm kids.  They know LOTS more than city kids.  Most of   them have watched animals both mate and give birth.  The plain fact are there, it is the emotional values that we have to teach them.              I find it rather upseting, frankly, that quite a few seem to come to me for advice because their own parents expect them to be virgins at    marriage.  I expect my children to be decent and caring.  Period.       Alan,                                                                                                                                           Briefly, a B-Tree is a generalization of red-black trees (a form of selfbalancing binary tree) where each node contains several keys (instaead  of one).  When "walking" the tree, an examination of all the keys in a  node will reveal the one (of several) paths from the node.                                                                                      A b-tree is excellent for disk storage of data as it greatly reduces thenumber of accesses in a typical search.                                                                                                         If I continue with my examples of trees, etc.,  I will lead into this   with more detail.  Insertion and Deletion with b-trees are quite        interesting operations.                                                                                                                         If you have specific questions, ask away....

I'm in a bit of a      hurry.                                                                  Nice presentation at Watfac.                                          THat is one problem with OS/2, they only built the OO features in the   pig WPS.  I would lik e to see what comes from Cairo...                WEll, what you were using was a little different.  In C++ you don't needto keep several files around if you don't want.  But in all honesty it  does make the code a lot more readable if certain files contain         different ideas.  This allows you to build libraries therefore reusable code ... one of the main ideas behind C++ ... generic reusable code.      Hi Jim,                                                                                                                                          Thanks for the information on btrees.  After reading your message, I am unclear about what you mean exactly when you say "balanced tree".    I've read about something called the "AVL" algorithm (or something like that), which "balances" a tree by trying to have the same number of     nodes on the left side of the tree as on the right side (within 1).  Is this the same kind of balancing you mean when you're referring to "tree balancing"?                                                                                                                                     .\lan                                                                      Thanks!  You were there? I don't think I knew anyone who was at the  presentation.                                                                                                                                   .\lan                                                                       Yeah -- I was aware that OOP languages are supposed to generate     great code reusability.  However, I was kind of turned off the idea whenI used Openscript.  I'm sure C++ is much different, but I won't know forsure until I've tried it!                                                                                                                       .\lan                                                                           Thanks for the response.  II found your viewpoint very          interesting.  I just wish that my parents had been that open with me.                                                                                                                           Colene Allen                    I'm discovering that the age is lower and lower by the year, andthat I am facing the fact that my relationship with my son will be a    difficult one to maintain unless I take a long hard look at my          attitudes, and make sure that I keep myself informed of what the teens  will face in terms of challenges and problems when my son gets a little older.

Maintaining the "red-black" property of a red-black tree is an   example of such dynamic balancing.

I think it has something to do with two consenting   adults (preferably  of the opposite sex...ie male and female) do        something that is supposedly enjoyable by both parties...I don't know   really ...all I do know is that is sure gets you into a lot of          trouble..!!!                                                            Do all versions of scan spread the filler virus? Try running scan       c:\/chkhi once. OK, no virus. Run it again. Alert!!. Filler virus is    active in high memory. I don't want to put the blame on scan, but I     can't figure where else it's comming from. One other thing. Does anyone else get temp files when they use dir|more together? Whatch out for     any change in command.com if your virus checker is in autoexec.bat.     Soory about the long delay in replying; I went on vacation before I     could call back.

Question:  how would you add more data items to the list?  If I remembercorrectly, (at least in GW-BASIC) there's a REDIM command to redemensionthe size of an array, but doesn't that wipe out the contents?  Or would you be limited to having X (as in DIM ARRAY(X)) members of the list?                                                                            In C (and other languages, of course) you'd just set a pointer in the   last data item to point to the new tail.  You could have a list limited only by available memory.  (Which is the point--it is easily            extensible.)                                                                                                                                    Andy S                                                                  The MUD sounds quite interesting.  (It could use a better name, though!)Is the entire source code available (just out of curiosity; I'm not     asking for it!)?                                                                                                                                Andy                                                                    If you use PDQ (as Eric so helpfully told me is the QuickBASIC          enhancement library), you can get code that compiles smaller than C code(or so I've been told).  There's a miniscule memory model floating      around for C, though, that allows you to compile nearly as small as     assembly language iff (a big _if_ and only _if_) you abandon            command-line argument support (at least the built-in stuff), and most ofthe run-time library!  This memory model doesn't include any            initialization code for the console routines (etc., etc., etc.) that    enable many RTL functions to work, and as a result, there is a reductionof ~4K overhead.  I once, using a FOSSIL driver, wrote a 50 byte        terminal program in Turbo C!  (For some reason TC++ made it bigger--the code was a bit less efficient.)  I was able to tweak it down after a bitmore work to 45 bytes.  I couldn't make it any smaller in assembly      either--as it was, I was using the pseudoregister variables and direct  DOS calls to do everything.  All that TC provided were loops!                                                                                   Andy S                                                                  My dad always told me he didn't know what else you could have more fun  at without laughing.                                                       You've got to be kidding! Even though you abandon many things by     getting code that size, the result is impressive -- 30 bytes for a      terminal program? Wow!  Does PDQ generate code smaller than a C code    compiled with the tiny memory model, and then converted to .COM file?                                                                           .\lan                                                                     Yeah, a REDIM used to nuke the contents of the array, but BASIC PDQ   (oops, make that PDS) 7.1 supports the REDIM PRESERVE statements,       which, of course, preserves the contents of the array.                  But, PDQ doesn't support that (not yet), but I've not had cause to use  it just yet, so I'm not worried.                                                                                                                 Oh, BTW, the new version of PDQ (3.0, which I haven't got yet) now     supports graphics commands, floating point math, and several other majorthings that were missing from previous versions. They also have a nice  "general purpose" toolbox, as well as a communications toolbox for      Visual BASIC, my favourite "nifty" language.

Others are: MUSH, MOO, MUCK, TIM and MUSE.        Dunno what they all stand for. Well, I heard MUSH is Multi User Shared  Hallucination. Things like that. Normally, each site has a specific     theme. Ie PernMUSH, my favorite site, is based on Anne McCaffreys world from the Dragonriders of Pern series. Online, you can wander around and explore Pern (recreated online in vivid detail), interact with others,  become a dragonrider, and other fun things. Hard to explain, you just   gotta experience it.

Yes there is just a change in theframework.. Bug fix from V3.0..  Do you know anyone who would be        interested in Borland C++ V3.0 for Windows.. This program is only for   windows programs(that's why I don't want it).. I don't want much, make  an offer...                                                                                                                                     Oh yeah, have you seen the GNU compiler (Freeware, or is it Shareware)  I'd like to play around with it if anyone has it (If there is an OS/2   Version, I think that it would work better (OS/2 dosen't like my old    version for DOS... <grin> )......                                                                                                               Also, Aparrently they have fixed the problem with the compiler, I don't know if you have encountered it, but supposedly (I haven't encountered  it yet either) the program will corrupt your Project file, and you have to rebuild it from scratch.. no problem if your project is small (IE    less than 30 or so *.CPP files...)                                      One thing.. the CPP compiler is so PICKY.. GEEZ  I spent hours trying tofind a major structural error, and it just was a small problem that the regular 'C' compiler would have ignored.. <G>                                                                                                   Oh well.                                                                                                                                        ___                                                                      |                                                                      _|OE                                                                    You've noticed that the WPS is a Memory Pig too. I'm thinking of going  up to 16 Meg, but I don't think that I can afford that right now.. I    have to finish paying for my CD-ROM drive, and I want to get one of     those new IDE controllers (250 US) they have about a two Meg. Cashe.. I think that they should have had this out a while ago..... Should be     FAAAAAAST! I also want another VGA card.. Probably an ATI Utlra.. I justhave a 1M Oak card......                                                                                                                        Is there a way (under OS/2) to load up a windows app, without the       DATA-Update, and the clipboard loading, I have an un-archiver, and I    really don't think that this is necessisary(excuse my spelling.. it's   6:00 am, and I haven't slept yet).                                                                                                              Anyhow,, Later..........                                                                                                                        ___                                                                      |                                                                      _|OE                                                                        Well I guess the upgrade is worth the $50 after all.  I'll probably send away for mine pretty soon.  As for BC++ for Windows, I can't say I know anyone who's looking for a C++ compiler, but if I find anyone, I'lllet you know.                                                                                                                                      I think I've seen the GNU compiler somewhere.  I'll check and make   sure.  If I do find a copy of it, I'll upload it here for you.  I don't think that I've encountered the project file bug, but you're right : I  haven't had a very large one yet.                                                                                                               .\lan                                                                   Re: young                                                                                                                                               In other words, your only as old as you feel.                                                                                                                                           Colene Allen            45 bytes, not 30 bytes!  30 would be absolutely amazing, I admit.  At   least, I _think_ it was 45 bytes...  I know for sure that I had 50; I   later got it down to 45 with as, but I can't remember for sure if I     did with C or not...  I'd have to see if QB is comparable with C in thisway...  it probably would be, though, in such a simple example _if_ you had access to pseudoregister variables, and I'm sure you don't.                                                                                 Andy S                                                                  I have to try out Visual BASIC sometime.  It looks quite interesting.                                                                           Andy S                                                                  It sounds like quite an invention!  How detailed is MUSH, MUD, etc.?    You think it would take a _long_ time to create something like that!  Isit very open-ended, or more like a multiple-choice (ie. limited)        Choose-Your-Own-Adventure?                                                                                                                      Andy S                                                                  I forgot to mention:  I recently got the terminal program down to 44    bytes in Assembler.  I believe this is a small as it can be made on a PCwith a FOSSIL driver.  I spent half an hour shearing off the last byte! It's not perfect, though:  it doesn't deinit the FOSSIL on exit, or dropthe DTR, etc. (although this can be useful)  Also, it has no real       features!  If you want ANSI, then you have to have a driver loaded.  It exits on Ctrl-Q.  Do you know any assembly language?  I could upload it if you'd like to see it.                                                                                                                        Andy S                                                                     44 bytes?  Jeez, that's incredible! Of course, I guess that in       assembler, it isn't _that_ hard to generate small code.  Even though    your terminal program is limited, it's not really a big deal -- it's a  trade-off between code size and features.  I'm impressed.                                                                                          I know a little about assembly language, but not enough to read      someone's code and understand it all.  Basically, I've just done some   "dabbling" in the language.  Most of my assembly program is simple and  useless (using DOS calls -- int 21h?).                                                                                                          .\lan                                                                   Any one here play Links 386 ?  I would like to trade some .REC files .  Has anyone used the Cobol compiler available on this board?             I'm experimenting a little with Cobol, and I am unable to get anything  to compile.  The compiler generates an .OBJ file and a .LST file, but   they are both 0 bytes long.  I know some people can code quite small    programs, but this is ridiculous!  My disk isn't full, but I'm not sure if this particular compiler requires huge amounts of space for temp     files when creating the .OBJ file or not.  Can anyone shed some light onthis?  Thanks,                                                                          Marc.                                                   Was it Groucho Marx who said, "You're only as old as the woman you      feel?"                                                                                                                                          Nice sentiment, anyway.

Thanks, but I'm far from being an old woman yet.                                                                                                                                                Colene Allen    Or as young as your lovers make you feel. ;<)                           Which Cobol compiler is it on this board?                               I'LL BET YOU'VE LEARNED ALOT, IN THE SUBJECT OF SBUT REMEMBER I SOME DAYWILL HAVE FORGOTTEN MORE THEN YOU EVEY KNEW.                            FINALLY SOMEONE ANSWERED.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INFO.            Of course, the JFK thing is interesting, but one senario has yet to be  persued. It even has historical precedent. The murder of Becket by a    group of knights who read a great deal into King Henry's plea to do     something about this man, could it be that this is what happened in     JFK's situation. There were many who could deal with him and found it   frustrating. I think there wasn't a conspirisy(sp?), just a small group who found an extreme way to deal with him.                              I would like to see this movie. Anyone seen it?                                 As I am unfamillar with what you are talking about in your      message, would you please be a little more specific.  I hate to comment on something that I am unsure of.

I'm a    good little girl.                                                                                                                                                                               Colene Allen            About all the program does is use DOS and BIOS calls!  I've decided to  upload it (if you think you want to examine it).  It'll be under the    name "TINYTERM.ZIP" in the programmer's area.  (If it's not there, then I didn't get around to ZIPping it up and ULing it yet.)                                                                                         Believe me, it's not too difficult.  I'm stressing this because I just  got through a nightmare weekend re-writing my serial routines (for the  FINAL TIME!!!) in Assembly.  I had lots of interesting problems,        creative crashes (with continually diagonally wrapping cursor, change ofvideo modes, interesting palette changes, screaming speakers, etc.--in  short, the whole works)...

You have to remember thatI am an old 60's hippy.  While lovers may not be required, the          possibility thereof is always required.  It keeps you on your toes and  alert, and make life interesting.  Probably the actuality would never   match the good humour involved in considering the possibility, but      nevertheless one must always consider.  To do otherwise is to get old   and staid.                                                              so it's disgusting...what's your point?

It is my view that life does not havequality without love, be it young puppy love, or the deep abiding love  that lasts a lifetime.  You are only as young as the romance that existsin your relationship with your loved one, and the commitment you have toeach other.  I hope that sounded right.  I'm not sure that I expressed  what I wanted to the way that I wanted to.                                                                                                              As for "safe" flirting, you can still get into trouble...

Sounds incredible.  I was very impressed with it, and I even think that it is better than "Pros and Cons" and "Radio KAOS".  Speaking of Radio  KAOS, did you know that it is no longer available in any record store   except for Dr. Disc in Kitchener.  I could not believe that it took me  twenty phone calls and visits to 15 record stores in order to find a    copy of it.                                                                                                                                             Anyhow, if you get the chance to pick up the new album, it is   just amazing.  If you like Jeff Beck, or Don Henley, then you gotta     check it out, because they are both on the album.  I will swear that youwill love this album.

The first person that asks me who Roger Waters is gets ignored fornot having gone out and gotten an education in rock history.            Trouble?  Only in a nice sense ...                                                                                                              I have found, over the years, that my imagination is not quiteup to     reality.  Reality is not oonly more fun, but so much more ... real?                                                                             I noticed you were on Jerry's board the other evening.  He runs a good  board, and is hooked into the THOUGHTS echo out of my board.  You may   wish to take a look at it.                                              Odyssey 1.50 is an amazing communications package.  It features         X/Y/Zmodem and few other protocals.  It allows the user to go to the DOSshell during file transmissions.  This means that you can run any       program you want provided you have enough memory left.  It features MNP emulation for error free transmissions (I find this to be slower        however).                                                               When running the program, I find it's best to set the "Use Software MNP"option to NO.  Otherwise Zmodem transfers on a 2400 baud modem tend to  be around 175 cps.  With the option set to NO the transfer rate is about237 cps.                                                                This program is truly great for those who want to multi-task but do not have enough memory to do so.                                                                                                                            - HDP                                                           Sure, I've had it for about a week now.  How's your score?

It seems that he    doesn't want to take my word for it.  I have to go and do a LOT of      HOUSEWORK, so I shall talk to you later.

Colene                    I have fired off a quick net mail note to Jerry with a "character     reference" for you.

Give me a Call starting Tuesday 10 pm -- 7 am       WSN PRODUCTIONS BBS -- 658-4941                                         I was comparing the murder of JFK to the murder of Becket. King Henry inthe middle ages didn't like the support Becket was lending to the Saxonsin England. He couldn't have one to kill Becket, but made it clear he   wished he could.                                                        A small group of Knights took him literally and murdered Becket in the  Church. I was suggesting that as JFK was not well liked, inspite of his popularity amongst ordinary people; he may have been killed by a small  but determined group. In fact, could conspirisy theories actually be    helping to hide the real killers? Ironic if this is true.               Life should be a little less safe? Yeah I can agree with that. I didn't go gliding this summer (you can call it that), I feel the worse for it. Powerless aircraft are the best.                                                                                       Ralph                    Hey Greg bud! Keeping in contact is harder then I thought. AS of this   message, I now work in Burlington for a company called ABEL Computers   Ltd. No, I don't have a car, but will get one soon. Any recomendations? No IROCs, sorry. The summer was quiet and largely uneventful. Steve     Henry is about the only guy from school I have hung out with,           semiregularly. How are things in Corman? Whats been happenin? Oh Yes!   Where do you live, now? What's the number. We'll have to collect some   where again. Phil's has improved since they turned the back area into a pool table area. They added a new and good Gritstone draft to the       selection. Any place, your new place, Steve's new place or Tim Horton's for that matter. Would we reconize each other if we saw us? If you see  Steve, bug him about the 386sx boards for $25 he says Mike is gonna get for us. What else can I say here? No no Girl friends, I'm working on it.Put much mileage on the Mazda? Hamilton's not that far away for me now. So even Hamilton enters the equation. Cristina's fine I trust. Say hi,  for me. Is it just a rumor or are you two planning difinately to get    married? Well, tally ho for now. Here from you soon Greg.

Sure, which course?

If your         interested give me a call  or write back.                               Just a thought,  Since your one of only a few females who bbs, do you   ever feel you are hit on a lot.  Just Wondering.                           Well, if your terminal program was indeed that small, I wouldn't     expect much more than DOS and BIOS calls, anyways.  Still, it's quite   impressive.   Anyways, along the lines of DOS and BIOS calls, I've      always wondered : Where the heck do you find out which BIOS interrupt   and functions do what?  I'm doing a bit of reading about using BIOS in  my programs, and although the text explains what's happening when I'm   loading the registers with values before executing int86(), these       mysterious numbers just seem to "come out of nowhere".  Are there any   books that you know of that has a list or whatever?                                                                                             .\lan                                                                       I don't run OS/2, but I read an article in PC Magazine a while ago  and it said that although there have not been any OS/2 specific viruses found to this date, DOS viruses can still infect your computer.         Obviously, if a virus is contracted using a DOS program, it'll affect   any of the DOS programs you have running (Ex. some programs won't work  like they should).  I don't think (but don't quote me on this) that     it'll do any damage to your OS/2 operating system though (is there even a COMMAND.COM to infect?!).                                                                                                                     .\lan                                                                   Well Rob, I am just getting my board started it goes up tommorow.  If   give me a call.  WSN PRODUCTIONS BBS -- 658-4941.                       As to suggestions, look around at other boards and see what kind of     software you would, like and then Download it and look at the sysop sideof it.  I am running spitfire, which I really like, I have also looked  at RemoteAccess, and Telegard.  Eventually I would like to get one of   the more exotic, software programs thought, ones not found around here  to often.  Then as to Graphics, names, files etc.  That I found just    sort of fell into place.  Mind you I have gone through 5 different namesfor my BBS.  If you want a copy of the latest spitfire give me a call.  Another BBS software that I think is good, is Boss.  Maybe you can talk Mark into letting you get a look or a copy.  Chat later.                How about Harbour Town for starters. I've also got the Barton Creek and Bountiful in High Res, plus all the original Links courses.             Which area shall we upload to ?                                         I don't have Bountiful in hi res yet, but any of the others are fine,   Harbour Town is ok for me.  Pick an area to upload and tell me.

Well, I have formatted my drive for the HPFS file system, so A virus    will have trouble doing a direct disk write, it would have to use a DOS interrupt, which I belive that OS/2 would catch.. I'm not concerned withvirusses... I can make it so no.... absolutely NO TSRs can be loaded in a specific DOS session!  (makes it a pain when a program uses part of   itself as a TSR  <G>)                                                   Anyhow, I don't think that I have anything to worry about. I only       download from reputable Bulletin Boards..

Colene                  Yes that would constitute a conspiracy, in the technical sense.         Of course the word conspiracy comes up in JFK's case because of the     noteriety of the man. In the case of Malcolm X for example, you only    hear the word murder. Even for M.L. King, conspiracy is not mentioned.  Also there is JFK's brother Robert. All these people wanted change. Theywanted it in a lethal and rigid environment, maybe not unlike Dante's   Florence. They may have been leading a popular movement, but forgot the reality of their time.                                                  Referring to the bit about 'recharge time' for an electric car.

That isthe reference I use for DOS and BIOS calls.  It is quite good in this   regard.  It has some other sections in it that discuss some aspects of  disks, communications, screen I/O, etc., only it doesn't go into very   much depth there.  It is an excellent DOS/BIOS reference, though.  It   has a back cover price of $27.95 Canadian (damn computer books cost a   fortune...).  It is written by Terry Dettmann and edited (for the 2nd   edition) by Jim Kyle.  Its ISBN number is 0-88022-458-4.

I have been using Quick C 2.0 for a while now, but it won't let me link from the    programming environment under OS/2. I tried the MS-DOS linker, the OS/2 linkers as well as the old quick C linker. Always get the same error    code (LINK.EXE returned errorcode -1), but when linking from the commandline it works great, as well as after booting native dos... Probably hasto do with Quick C loading the linker and an OS/2 interrupt. Anyway,    what compiler DO work flawlessly under OS/2. Preferably one similar to  and/or compatible with Microsoft compilers or an OS/2 specific one.

Have u played with the DOS settings?     Can't think of which ones could cause the QC problem, but there may be  something.  Also, have you tried booting an actual DOS Image under OS/2 and running it from there?                                                                                                                      As to mail readers, I don't have any, but have seen a number of native  OS/2 readers available on CRS and other big boards around, so they are  out there.  Apparently they are quite good too.  Same advice as above   goes for SLMR, the boot image may help.                                                                                                         Make sure you settings are correct, as neither SLMR nor QC really does  anything weird..especially compared to some of the games I've had up andrunning!

I have a book 1500 pages long (Programming FoxPro 2.0 by M. Liskin), and I'm currently just past page 800. FP seemslike a decent program, but the impression I get is that a program is onehuge collection of little pieces of code. The author keeps warning aboutthe SQL query command (I'm very familiar w/ SQL, C, and more), saying itgenerates huge disk files. We're looking at working with MANY databases (distributed on a CD), with some being quite large. Once she says that  you just have to have enough space on disk to hold the generated query, yet several times she warns of using 'all available disk space'. Anyone out there used FoxPro? Can you confirm/deny this? The queries I'll be   using probably won't select more than 200 items out of 10-20            thousand...

He has been compared to A.C. Clarke                                                                                 His titles are at the Library/Gallery if you're interested.                Thanks for the information, Andy.  I'll see if I can find a copy of that book.  It sounds like just the thing I'm looking for.  In the way  of computer books, $30 doesn't sound _too_ bad; I've seen A LOT worse   (up in the neighbourhood of $70!).                                                                                                              .\lan                                                                      Thanks.  I'll check out that book as well.  Do you know a good place to find it?                                                                                                                                     .\lan                                                                     You are using the linker that came with OS/2.   Go into the OS/2      directory and rename LINK.EXE to LINK.OS2.   Check your paths and such, Quick C WILL work under OS/2 with no problems.  I know, I use it.                                                                                  Alan                                                                    Does this game require that you have a VESA driver in order to play? I heard the game is rather demanding on your system and the             manufacturers really cut down the market when they made this game.                                                                              .\lan                                                                      Have you actually gotten the equivalent of 9600 throughput using your2400MNP?  I used to own an ATI2400etc/e modem with V.42bis and MNP 5    "compression", and the best CPS I ever got was around 400 when I was    transferring a text file using MNP 5.  I _never_ got anywhere near      9600cps, although I did lock the baud rate at 9600 in my terminal       program.  All in all, I find that 2400MNP modems are basically garbage  (it only saves maybe several seconds on a 100K file or so -- compressed that is with MNP 5 off).  What modem are you using?                                                                                             .\lan                                                                      I have a Sound Blaster card that I've been thinking about selling    (maybe upgrading to an ATI stereo F/X).  It doesn't have the CMS chips  or whatever.  Make me an offer.                                                                                                                 .\lan                                                                   I just read Computer Gaming World magazine, and in there is some realy  awsome games that will be released within the next half year. Three     software companies are diveloping Mech Warior Type games. On from       PSYGNOSIS called "Walker" places the player in control of a robotic     mechanoid  that is trying to stave off assaults of infantry, armored andair force units. The animation is suposed to be awsome.                 Also NOVALOGIC is seeking a publishing agreement on ist fictional robot combat strategy game, ULTRABOTS, and post-holocaust battlefield game,   BATTLEFIELD 2000, but plans to launch a helicopter simulation, MAXAMUM  OVERKILL 92?. It swa written entirely in assembly language and featuringsprite animation at 3208240 resolution, this awesome simulation clips   along at 20 frames per second.( film is 30per/sec) cool eh...             I have played around with the DOS settings to no avail. I have not    tried to boot a VDM because an incompatibility with my floppy controller(IBM is still working on a fix for me since the first three they mailed me didn't fix everything (but they're getting closer)). Something I justthought of is booting a VDM from drive D: ... may actually be possible  under OS/2, I'll try in a few minutes. Thanx for the reply. Oh, and do  you know if there is a BBS carrying OS/2 files in (or local to) KW?       Hmmmm, I guess I'll have to try to re-install Quick C to see if it    makes a difference. I have not yet tried to run it from a VDM, just fromthe DOS compatibility box. Also, what version of Quick C are you using? Orian electronics on Lancaster Street.                                  Yes.                                                                      Does anybody knwo if there is a BBS in KW that carries OS/2 filebases (other than the big guys like EX-10)?                                                                                                             If not, would anybody be interested in me setting one up (I would needan OS/2 BBS program though, and would prefer help with phone bills).                                                                            On a sidenote: the Foxhole will not go back up under it's old name or   another name (sorry, I know I promised it would be back), but because ofthe switch to OS/2 I put writing my own program on hold until I know    enough about it to write an OS/2 specific one. As I wrote earlier in    this message though, I am willing to set up an OS/2 specific BBS if     there is enough interest in one.

I never really look at names   under a message, I just hit <R> for Reply...                            Hello!                                                                  I've recently written a program for work using QB4.5, it's used to log  mail order film, and generate ALOT of different statistics. It's workingvery well, and appears to be bugfree. However, they would now like to   connect a dumb terminal to the pc and do order entry from a different   room. I've tried connecting the dumb terminal (null modem) to COM1 and  issuing MODE COM1:9600,E,7,2 and then CTTY COM1,  but I end up with     device write errors... I've also tried using X00 fossil with no luck. I can communicate if I use a terminal program on the pc (TELIX, PCPLUS    etc...)                                                                 Anyways, when I try to communicate with QB, I keep getting device       timeout errors, even when using the fossil. (I'm not much of a          programmer yet...) I've tried using the Easydoor library to get an idea of how to re-write the order entry to use the comport, but the Easydoor gives an error saying that  X00 is the wrong version or not installed.  Then if I try to restart QB, my computer locks up. I'm getting quite    frustrated because I know that it must be a stupid little problem...

I have been BBSing for years and have seen   many boards. My interest has expanded into possibly running a board of  my own. After looking at several different operating systems, like      remote access, teleguard, Orion, and others I am trying to look at it   from the other side. The operators side! This is why I am seeking       information before I start. I have noticed that some different programs need "fossil" drivers. What is a fossil driver, and do you need many of these to get a system running?                                          Thanks,                                                                 Rob                                                                     Hi,                                                                     I guess you didn't get the rest of my message. I was replying to a      message you had left to another person. I don't remember what the reply is but it was about marriage. Anyway, thanks for even replying to a     single "Hi".

Gimme a shout everyone at 742-9273 (Ask for Cedric, eh?)!!!!            What a Fossil Driver is exactly I am not sure,  I didn't even have one  until the other day.  Spitfire, doesn't need one at all, but I know how you feel a lot of the other programs do.  I am now working on Supper BBSsoftware, to make a back up system for my bbs, and it need the fossil   driver.  you only need one to get the software working I believe, but   that would depend of the software.  If you can find BNU170.ZIP it is a  fossil driver, with instruction and somemore stuff.  If you call my     board 651-0674 I have it on-line, in the I.B.M. UTILITIES AREA.  I thinkarea #2 (I think???)  Maybe someone else out there can enlighten us on  what excactly a fossil driver does, and how it interacts with the       computer, modem etc.                                                    Chat later hope that helps?                                               I have been very interested as of late in getting some older issues ofthe Dark knight collection.  Do you have any idea where I can get some.    Also, you can't suggest where to look for the history of the X-men?                  -----interested.                                        Hi Dave,                                                                   I am a Nuclear and Particle Physicist, and I am very interested in   alternate modes of propulsion.  The theory of a car running on water hasbeen around for a while.  As far as I knew, the energy required to      separate the water in the first place is too costly.  There is of coursethe possibility of using an alternator to recharge a powerful battery.  However I am not aware of anyone ever perfecting such a car.  Do you    have proof?  I know someone who would market this product and not sell  out.                                                                    I am surprised.  Do you not think that the oil companies at least by    now, forsee their own demise.  Would it not seem logical for them to    expand to new avenues when they arise.  Particularly since they now havethe money and power to do so.                                             The problem is with the way the BIOS handles handshake lines. It will not receive correctly without them, but when sending it gives an error  when the receiver tells the pc to stop sending for a while... Instead ofMODE COM1:9600,e,7,2 you have to enter MODE COM1:9600,e,7,2,P. The ",P" tells the computer to retry sending a byte until the handshake line     clears.

It's on the corner of King and Dupont.It's run by a friend of mine and he can get you just about anything.    Sorry for the late response (busy at school), but ya, I was there, at   the top right, longer brown hair, about 6'3", I even went up and talked to Jennifer once (I was once in watfac, about two or three years ago).  WEll, if you go to 16 megs, the system won't need to thrash near as     much, so that should speed things up.  Thanks god prices are going down,so that should help you out.                                            Instead of getting the Ultra, I would suggest getting a Widnows graphicsaccelarator (okay not just windows), this would speed things up better  then the Ultra.  The Ultra is faster then most accel. for DOS VGA, but  generally accel. are faster then the Ultra for GUI's...I would suggest  changing the OAK though, I have never been pleased with them there      cards.                                                                  I can't say I know of a way to stop the DATA(DDE)links and clipboard,   OS/2 needs them just in case, the only other way is to do it seemless, Idon't think that will require the loading of them (though planted on theshell is a pig again).                                                  re: ATI Ultra                                                                                                                                   You talk about the ATI Ultra and Graphics accelerator boards (or        graphics engines) as if they are two seperate things. Sorry to tell you you're wrong (and probably start a flame war against myself), but the   ATI Ultra, Ultra pro, and ultra/8514 ARE accelerator boards using a     graphics processor. There is no way a normal VGA card can be up to 24   times faster than the old IBM VGA, no matter how fast its memory is,    unless it is either a local bus card, or is not a VGA conttroller, but aVA compatible graphics engine (ie: a so called windows accelerator).    Unlike most other accelerators though, the ATI Ultra is available in    EISA and local bus versions as well as the common ISA one. (Although    local bus is not nearly as fast as it could/should be or is made out to be. EISA is just as fast (or nearly so). But I think I'm getting carriedaway here...                                                                                                                                                                            Maverick                          Same topic as earlier, different question. I've heard people mention  OS/2 2.0 and the GNU C compiler in the same sentence, but don't rememberexactly in what context. Does anybody know if gcc-2.2.2 will run under  OS/2 (or DOS), if so, can it compiler OS/2 specific applications (does  it have libraries for OS/2), and if so, what about licensing code       compiled with it. Also: is it worth the 18 MB it will take up on my     harddisk? Also, I can ftp the C source the gcc, but what compiler do I  use to compile it so I can use it? Any ANSI compatible one, or does it  need certain extensions (ie: Microsoft, Borland, Aztec, or whatever).                                                                                                           Maverick                                You failed to note some major complications for a hydrogen fueled car.  1. the fuel is highly explosive, and is not very dense.                 2. they have yet to perfect a way of storing enough hydrogen safely in atank for a car to travel any resonable distance.                        Although I do hear they are working on a way to bond hydrogen to a metalfor easier storage, the problem is re-releasing the hydrogen from the   metal for the car's engine to use.                                      re:wanting change and forgetting reality                                                                                                                I have to agree with you.  It seems that anyone who represents  change or a movement towards a better of different way of doing things  tends to be viewed as being a danger to society and not in line with thestatus quo.  It is  a very sad reflection of the way in which humanity  deals with the ever present process of learning.  We can only learn the hard way.

The younger you feel, the       younger you are in attitude.                                                                                                                                                                            Colene          Saw a hillarious video, called "The Three Fugitives", with Nick Nolte   and Martin Short.  Nolte played a gruff, but kind hearted guy, while    Short was great as a muddled up parent.  Keep an eye out for Martin     Shorts hairdoo.                                                         Have you seen Short's new movie yet?  Captain Ron?  I don't know anyone who has seen it yet and was wondering if it was worth going to or if I  should wait till it hits the stores.                                    Fossil stands for "Fido Opus Sea<something> Serial Interface Layer". It is a TSR or device driver which provides routines for the serial ports  that the BIOS can't provide, but are needed for a BBS or terminal       program. Using calls to a FOSSIL instead of making your own routines    makes it easier to port a program from one kind of computer to another, as it ideally needs only a different FOSSIL, and the rest of the programstays the same. Quite a few BBS packages need one, some don't. I don't  think any terminal programs need one (apart from the 40 byte one in one of the file areas here). Two good ones are BNU and X00. I personally    would use (and have used when I ran the Foxhole) BNU.                   re: DIplomacy                                                                                                                                   Ahhh, someone tried to start one last year (Mark Oosterveld I believe), but it never made it off the ground. I would be very interested to      either play by mail, or over a BBS if somebody can do the maps in some  graphics format (preferably GIF), although maybe ANSI would be enough todo it too (ever seen a world map in the BBS game Global Warfare?).      Anyway, I have played the game a few times, but don't own it, and would like to at least get a copy of a map so I know where I can go from whereI am. My level of familiarity would probably about a 6 I guess, My phonenumber is 886-2028. I won't give out my address unless I know for sure  we are playing a PBM game (I don't like giving out my address in a      public message). I can't say what nation I'd like to be for sure        without seeing a map first, although Russia does sound good, or maybe   Germany. Reply here when you have any more info, or call me (Marcel) at the number I stated earlier.                                            I have only seen the previews for Captain Ron, so can't really say to   much, although Short has been pretty reliable for some good laughs in   the past. We will probably get the video when it is released.  Going to the movies is a treat, but toooo expensive.                             If you find movies expensive, why not go on cheap night?  Personally, I find money somewhere to go to the show.  Watching it on video is nothinglike watching it on the big screen.  You lose so much when they scan it to bring it down to tv size.  It would be all right if they put movies  on tape in the letter-box format (with the black bars on the top and    bottom).  It doesn't bother me one bit.  I could live with it.  I had towatch BACKDRAFT on video because I missed it in the theatres.  I still  loved it, but what would it have been like on the big screen say with   THX sound as well?  A perfect example of this is Star Trek VI.  I saw itin the theatre in Toronto with the THX surround sound.  It was aurally  amazing and visually satisfying.  When I watched it on viewer's choice, it lacked a whole lot of substance.  I guess that if you don't see them in the theatre first, you'll never miss what it could have been.....

A couple            of friends are currently telnetting to UW from accounts that            they scammed at York.  Another friend (UW student) had an               account at U of T last winter term.                                     I was wondering if anyone had a 'pop up' TSR ascii text editor.         I don't need anything fancy (and the less mem it uses the better.       I'm programming 'C' in a strange sort of UNIX like DOS shell            program. (Very strange) Anyways, the editor available in it             is just a straight line editor. I've checked everywhere I know          for one and can only find TSR 'memory' editors, not ASCII.              (I think I've checked every FTP site from Washington to Sweden)         Any suggestions would be appreciated...I really don't feel like coding  my own...                                                               Thanks                                                                          A young man went to the doctor, complaining of an awful lisp.   Giving him a thorough examination, the doctor determined that the young man's problem was the size of his penis.  It was so large that it was   actually pulling his tongue off center.  Performing an emergency        operation, the doctor shortened the organ and sent the man on his way.          Several weeks later, the patient returned, complaining that     while his lisp was gone, his sex life had gone down the tubes.                  "I'd like my penis back", he said mournfully.                           At this, the doctor looked him straight in the eye and said,    "Thcrew you."                                                             When you use MNP error correction (either software emulation, or      hardware through the modem), the best protocol to use is Ymodem-g, sincethis protocol doesn't use error correction. BUT it only works when both sides can handle MNP. Then again, if the speed goes down from 237cps to 175, I think somebody should write a faster routine to do MNP emulation.If a $150 modem can do it at a reasonable speed, a $1000 computer shouldalso...                                                                 Just to jump in here, a car running on water would never be feasable. Ifit was possible to seperate water into oxygen and hydrogen using less   energy than you got back from burning the hydrogen with the oxygen      creating water again, you would have a "perpetuum mobile", or something that would run forever before it broke down. Considering the fact that  you would always use a bit of energy in the way of heat, this is        impossible. I think the best way to build an environment safe car is to go electrical and go solar power.                                                                                                                                       Maverick                                        Ummmm, hydrogen powered vehicles DO exist. Some tour busses in europe   run on hydrogen. Like propane, the store in under high pressure, up to  the point where it becomes liquid (like rocket fuel). The problem is notstoring hydrogen, but building a small engine that can stand the heat.  Hydrogen burns at a VERY high temperature, much higher than that of     gasoline, propane, or even M85. It is not feasable for a car, but for a bus or truck it is. BTW, ford has build a car that can run on any       mixture of gasoline and M85, where a sensor connected to an electronic  fuel injection system controls the amount of oxygen going into the      engine for best combustion (M85 needs more oxygen). Problem with this   stuff is that although it burns a lot cleaner and gives more power, it  is not yet very widely available (only arount TO as far as I know aroundhere, but almost every car in Brazil runs on it), and it reacts with    rubber and some metals, causing it to slowly eat through the gas tank   and lines unless they have been specially build for it.                                                                                                                         Maverick                                They only way to get 960 bytes per second on a 2400 baud modem running  MNP 5 is to transfer a file which consists of only one (1) character    repeated over and over again. Even in this case a compression progran   will give better results. MNP 5 is only useful for text as in BBS menus etc. Still, 400cps is an improvement of more than 50%...                Then again, price doesn't make it useful on 2400 baud modems. Get a 9600baud or faster modem, with MNP5, and you can get good speeds for a      reasonable price (depending on your bank acount).                                                                                                                               Maverick                                Ok folks, please d/l the file WSN.zip in file area one.  Upload it whereever you can.                                                           Sorry to jump in here as well (grin), but I think you are missing the   point.  The car does not run on water directly.  You use a cheap energy source (solar is ideal) to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.  The   two fuels are what powers the car.  The fuel separation is not done in  the vehicle.                                                                                                                                    Jim                                                                         Sorry about the late response too (same reason :).  Well, I wish I  could say I remember seeing you, but like I said -- I can barely        remember anyone there!  I really enjoyed working with the watfac programin the summer.  What project did you work on when you were there?       (perhaps we should move this to a private message base, too).                                                                                   .\lan                                                                       Oh, I see...  I was wondering about 960cps with a 2400 modem.  I'm  sure it's possible if all you're sending is that kind of redundant file.I'm sure I'd be able to achieve some lightning fast speed with my HST ifthat was the file I sent.  For all practical purposes, MNP5 is really   garbage though.  More often than not, file transfer speeds will suffer  when your downloading/uploading compressed files.  I owned my 2400 MNP  for a short period of time, and found by a couple of weeks, I'd just    turn MNP5 off altogether because the menus came _so_ chunky, and the keyspeeds (reaction when you press a hot key for instance) was really slow.Anyways, I wouldn't trade my HST for the world now :).                                                                                          .\lan                                                                       About the ATI Ultra, do you own one?  I recently purchased a new    system with an Ultra card, and I'm having trouble getting Windows to    work with it 100%.  If you have any knowledge of getting the Ultra to   work with Windows, I'd really appreciate it.  Thanks.                                                                                           .\lan                                                                   Well Colene, have you tried SPITFIRE !

I wuz quite surprised to see           them.....Right now, they are 10% of the users !!!                       it all seems like their remaking the original TV series'. first BATMAN, than the addams family (even worse than batman) as for batman, he only  says i thing in the whole movie                                                                                                                 "I AM BATMAN!"                                                          thats all he really says.                                               beauty and the beast was a good movie. funny yet it had a sense of      feeling in it, like picasso's art.                                      i think THE LAWNMOWER MAN would fit into that category                  i have a satellite dish. just curl back and scan the skies from out of afew hundred stations, including HBO,Cinemax,First Choice,Viewers Choice pay per view, cable video store pay per view,request TV payperview and  tuns more.                                                              JFK sucked! but it could of been better if they did a little (of what   it needed) cutted unneccesary parts like "Let thy justice be done when  thy heavens fall"                                                       i havent but i would have loved to see it                               i thought that PSYCHNOSIS was strictly Amiga/Atari ST world of games, i have an ST and 2 Games from PSYGNOSIS and the graphics are awesomer thanawesome can kick VGA's A*S                                              hello! i am intrested in the modem/voice/FAX switching device but i needcash. how bout lowering the brice to 100 if you can please!             Yes, and now they are even ripping of the CD userrs to two of my friendsbought the CD when I was in the states and it didn't have the hidden    song (not that I like it I think it is a bunch of garbage).             I was thinking the same thing I'm not to fond of Micheal Jackson or     Clasical, but I love to listen to Metal and of course Seatle type       music(ie. pearl jam, temple of the dog).... by the way have you ever    herd of a band called DAYGLO ABORTIONS (may not be to clean but some    parts are pretty funny)                                                 I love Pearl jam ect. I would have loved to go to lollapalooza.  If you like those types of bands you should get the sound track to teh movie   singles (I don't have it but it looks good to me)                       Re: Fax/modem switch                                                                                                                            Unfortunately, i can't lower the price anymore !  I would be taking a   HUGE loss !  Not what anyone wants !  Hmmm, i might consider            installments !                                                          I'm very interested in obtaining an MFM fixed disk. I have a 40 meg one now, but would like to get another of any capacity. Post me the specs   and offer for it. Controllers with the hard drive would also be taken,  after all what good is a controllers for MFM if you don't have the fixeddisk? I don't need the controller but I think I know some one who would like it. So what do you say? Or do I have to say the heck with it and   get an IDE brand new?                                                                                                                           Ralph.                                                                  I think that you should be used for experiments.  I think that you're   being foolish and insensitive and crude.  I think that experiments      should be done on you.  Are you Jewish?                                    I'm pretty sure that the problem I'm having isn't a driver problem.  I've already tried different ATI drivers, including the ones most recenton ATI's BBS.  Oh well, I'll just call my dealer and bother him again   :).                                                                                                                                             .\lan                                                                   I agree.  You bring up a good point on whether or not the fetus should  be used for research.  I feel that it should.  What else are they going to do with them?  What DO they do with them anyhow?  I'm not too sure   about the "growing" of fetus parts to maturity to provide us with a     donor supply though.  How would they go about doing that without        incubating the fetus and letting it grow?  I'm sure they could pump it  full of all sorts of drugs to make it grow faster, but would the fetus  develop a concious then?  If it did, would it be a viable human being?  I'm against testing on animals, but what about prisoners?  Only the onesserving life in prison with no chance for parole.  All the sex fiends   and murderers and that sort.  I have no problem with that at all.  I    feel that would cut down on the prison over-population problem and also cut the spending of our tax dollars keeping these cretins in prison.    Back to the fetus issue though, I am not sure that letting the mother   keep the child until the last instant would be such a good idea.  Maybe it could be removed and incubated elsewhere.  Oh well, catch you later.                                                                         Mark.                                                                   What does Ralph's heritage have do with his opinion?  Remember, this is an open forum and he was only bringing up a new topic for discussion.   By the way, are you pro-choice or a right-to-lifer?

Wipe it off.                                                    What do Elephants use for tampons?                                              Sheep.                                                          What do Elephants use for vibrators?                                            Epileptics.  (No offense, anybody)                                Finally, someone with some taste!                                                                                                               My bands:  Jane's Addiction,  Alice in chains,  hHead,  Pearl Jam,                 Sonic Youth,  Smash'n Pumpkins, Forgotten Rebels,                       Rush,  Black Sabbath etc etc ...                                                                                                     I am going to see Alice In Chains with Ozzy on Nov 4th ... looking    forward to Alice more though...                                         Well, my main concern was the legal "nicety" of who is a person and who isn't. Legally, a fetus isn't a person and an imprisoned convict is. So I doubt there would be any chance of carrying out scientific research ona living person. Reopening the Westray mine and making the convicts workit might be a better way for them to repay there debt to society. In anycase, you half to include Roman Catholic priests in the "sex fiend"     category. Could the public really allow experiments on them despite     their crimes? Actually, I this isnt't a "cutting edge" discussion, as   brain tissue from fetus' has been used on alzheimer patients with       promising results. Of course there was that case were I think a sister  or close relative bore a LIVING child for bone marrow transplant.       Anybody bother to ask the child if it thought it was OK?                                                                                        Ralph                                                                   Well, I see you disagree with something which actually is close to beingdone as standard proceedure. Actually, I'm kind of interested why you   suggest that I as a legal person and law abiding citizen with a         contriversial comment should have experiments done upon them? Foolish isthe only charge I could possibly see as being expectable. Insensitive   and crude, that is something that is central to science and the pursuit of knowledge. Not being worried if the wording is correct, especially ifit is supposed to be politically correct. Could the Kinsey experiments  have occured in a sensitive environment? Could it be anything other thencrude? Since this is an adult base I think I feel like adding another   dimention to the abortion issue. How about manditory abortions for womenwho fall under a certain income level?                                                                                                          Ralph.                                                                                                                                          P.S. Oh yes, I almost forgot. No I'm not Jewish, as if that has anythingto do with it. I'm quite anglosized from several generations of people  who came from what is now monolithic Germany. I can state comments quiteobjectively as I have never gotten any women or teenager pregnent. I    speak as one of the many in this country who has to pay for the mistakesof others. Perhaps, you can let us in on some of your comments?         I know there are BGI driver kits around for borland, and someone must   have made one to handle mode 13 (for vga cards). Has anyone heard of    one?                                                                    Thanks                                                                  I believe that I heard about the marrow transplant case and about the   brain tissue transplant as well.  As for the RC priests who committed   sex crimes, I don't believe that they should be held above anyone else. In fact, I feel that they have committed two crimes by their acts.  One,(the obvious one) the sexual molestation of children, and two, betrayal of the public trust.  We are supposed to look up to these people as     pillars of our society.                                                                                                                         As to what you called "the legal nicety of who is a person and who      isn't", I think that they gave up the right to free choice once they    committed their crimes.  I'm not talking about the car thieves or any   other petty crimes.  I'm talking about the multiple murderers and the   ones who totally ruin a child's future by molesting them.  I work in a  group home who's clients range from kids with behavioural problems to   ones that have been abused.  It's sad to see what happens to these kids.Most of them just stay in the system until it kicks them out.  They haveno future.  Enough about that though, I seem to be straying from the    original topic.  Yes, I don't mind using fetus cells or any of their    parts to help a person who is suffering from Alzheimers or any other    disease.  I think that's a great idea.  As to whether or not a fetus is a person, there are some religions that state that a person isn't a     person until maturity.  (But then again, that doesn't include females.) I'm not a party to that notion however.  My belief is that the fetus    would be a person if it could survive without the aid of artificial     support or the mother's body.                                                                                                                   Mark.                                                                   Has anyone out there seen the new Seagal movie, Under Siege?  If so, howdid you like it?  I thought it was very violent in a good way.  Not bad acting all around except for a couple of the supporting characters.  Thestory line was believable and very today oriented.  I would see it      again.  If you are like me and live in Kitchener/Waterloo, you might    want to try seeing it at the 3 star cinemas just outside of Guelph.  TheCapitol is just not a good theatre.                                                                                                             Has anyone seen Last of the Mohicans or 1492 yet?  I haven't seen them  and would like some feedback on their quality.                                                                                                  Mark.                                                                   What do you call an epileptic in a garden?                                      A seizure salad.                                                                                                                        What's the difference between an epileptic corn farmer and a prostitute with diarrhea?

What do you give and elephant with diarrhea?                                    Plenty of room.                                                                                                                         Why can't two elephants go swimming at the same time?                           Because they only have a pair of trunks between them.                                                                                   Did you hear about the new hangover cure?                                       You mix orange juice and milk of magnesia....a Phillips                 screwdriver.

Ya got good taste                                                       U2 is amazing, you should try KMFDM, Sonic Youth, The Soup Dragons or   Primus.  They'll all be up there in a coupla' months.                   I missed Lolapalooza, but I witnessed Z00-TV, just amazing              Later...                                                                WHAT?????

I get some sort oferror when I run it from a DOS session and a little menu shows up       giving me the option to display the registers, abort, and something else(I can't really remember).  Has anyone gotten BC++ to work with OS/2?   Any suggestions?  The hardware I'm using is a 486-50 w/ 8 megs RAM and  SVGA display (if that makes a difference).  Thanks in advance.                                                                                  .\lan                                                                   re: OS/2 2.0 config.sys                                                                                                                         If there was any line noise it must have been coming in to you, because I didn't notice any in the file. By the way, what do you mean you boughtthe windows upgrade package? You have to PAY to get the winos2 3.1      kernel? No fair! If only I lived in the states I could have gotten the  Beta with it and the 32 bit graphics engine for free. (And I also would have had access to the $15 developers toolkit CD, but the 1 800 number  is not available from here...)                                                                                                                  Oh well, I'll have to waste more money... OS/2 itself dropped by over   $100 within 2 weeks of when I bought it (paid $249 for the upgrade,     available now for $69).                                                 Exactly WHAT error are you getting? I don't have Borland C++, so I can'trecreate the error myself...                                            You're right Elmo is cool.  He should have his own show.  I hav'nt heardthe Elmo song though.  Do you or anyone know it?                           Actually, I think I may have given you the wrong impression.  I just bought OS/2 2.0 "Windows Upgrade Package" -- the deal you can get for   $79.  I'm pretty sure I don't have the WINOS/2 3.1 kernel.  Do you have to send away for this? (Ugg... more fees!! :).                                                                                                  .\lan                                                                                                                                              I can't recall exactly what error it is.  I'll try it again the next time I boot from OS/2 and write you another message then.  It was reallystrange though.  I really like OS/2 other than the fact I can't use my  favorite piece of software! :).                                                                                                                 .\lan                                                                   I assume the winos2 3.1 kernel is going to be released together with theservice package (all bug fixes so far). This was scheduled for October  19 I think (last monday) but has been postponed until "the end of the   month", probably meaning the 30th, as the 31st is a friday (correct?).  My guess is it'll be available for just the postage.                    I didn't know that they were doing a concert.                                   Would have been great to get tickets though.  It sounds like it will be a great concert.                                                I am looking for a 40 meg Ide hard drive, if anyone knows a good place  to purcase one or knows where I can get a good deal please let me know. I can now access DataPac.  Can someone tell be the procedure to access  Compuserve throught DATAPac???                                                                  Thanks in advance                                                                       Richard Begley                     Sounds good.  Hopefully, there won't be any upgrade fee to get the   new kernel.  I'm in no rush -- I just ran into some more video card     problems with my machine, and OS/2 isn't running correctly.  Looks like I've got to get my machine looked at before anything else.                                                                                      .\lan                                                                   Let's here from all Jays fans who saw the game.  Way to go Winfield!!!! I hope we can keep it now that we have it!!!!   YEAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!   Hi David, I just saw your message.  In the november issue of I think Carand Driver magazine they have done their first test drive of a electric car using lead acid batteries.  It has acceleration of 0-60mph in 7.8 I believe and it can travel close to 400miles in one charge.  This is     fairly new stuff but you might want to check it out because the         technology was there in planning when you made that statement.  I do    agree with you on the control the world issue it just is'nt happening   Ok, I liked Under Siege as well. Good, fast plot that was refreshingly  character orientated.                                                    1492 was a good movie as well. Chris was shown as a unique thinker and idealistic explorer, where all the bad that was going to happen in our  hindsight was done by others. Whoa! Real demonization of aristocracy.   Though, Justin will be happy to find them full of life. I thought       Signria or however you spell it did a good job of making Isabela what wenow see her as. An anal preppy catholic school girl, not willing to showher feminine side. Who knows? Maybe she was that way. Any way, the      classic near mutiny took place with classic crew jitters. I don't think they came ashore for the first time all carring flags, but they did in  the movie. So sure, see it in the theatre. On a tuesday. You might miss the effects of the big screen shots. You might want to brush up on your explorers and there historically written stories to get a grasp on any  allusions you see. Oh yes! The burning of heretic scenes should please  all the sadists. I'll let the natives suprise you though. Enjoy.                                                                                Ralph. I liked them both.                                               This CRTC has deregulated the long distance industry in Canada, meaning that other companies can NOW compete with Bell Canada for both long     distance service and also to install phone lines.  How do people feel   about this "breaking" of Bell Canada's monopoly status?  This is        creating lots of new jobs (as well as spin-off industries), and it is   creating new demand for telecommunication products as well as reducing  long distance costs in Canada!  But how do you feel about this?         Yup you are thinking of the right author. Gene Wolfe did write the      Torturer series. Sorry to take so long to reply, I dont get here very   often.                                                                  Greg                                                                    They are begining to release some of their games on IBM either threw a  IBM software company or most likely they are converting it themselves.  eg.. the game ARMORGEDEN is now available for IBM. I had a Amiga 500 andthe graphics are awsome but the flight sim's are a little behind. I do  miss my Amiga and all the games I had...                                hahahahahahahahaha...                                                   I think that the price that the pope paid for the camera is $10,000 not $10 which would have been a good price                                  I can't remember the names of some examples, but I'm pretty sure I have some games from psychnosys for IBNM and compatibles, my Sinclair ZX     Spextrum (64K big brother of the Timex 1000, basically same as C64, and quite popular in Europe at the time), my C64, and Yes, even my Timex    1000 (although those do require the 16K expansion pack...) Those were   the good old days, when a "whopping" 64K RAM was more than anybody couldever ask for, and the 640K limit was not even seen as a limit. What     happened that is causing my 8M machine to swap to disk every now and    then now? (My swap file hangs around 2 or 3 MB average)                                                                                                                         Marcel                                  Computer prices have steadily been going down for as long as I can      remember (and just plummeted 16 months ago), and they only time anythinghas ever gone up was RAM chips in 1987. Are you sure computer prices aregoing up? If so, does anybody enough about the economy to explain this  to me? (And don't just tell me our economy is f*cked up, I already know that).                                                                                                                                                                                          Marcel                  Hi!                                                                     I was wondering if anyone in the area was running (or has run)          BSD386 0.0 or 0.1.  I've just managed to ftp it down from               the University of Michigan and plan to install it on a partition        of a 486/50.  I would specifically be interested in the serial (modem)  communications aspect of it.                                            Furthermore, if anyone wants to experiment with this new 'UNIX' like    operating system, I would be happy to somehow (I've only got 2400 baud) get you the installation and binary disks..(14 1.44M disks)             Thanks for listening                                                    Jerry                                                                   I'm new to this board.will sombody give me a call &we can chat about    whatever                                                                Has he done any other books at all?  I really liked that Toturer series!Are dollar fluctuated and the suppliers up thier prices by 20%  My      friend is a local service/sales guy and all of the suppliers are up.    One other thing I would like you to know is that the Canadian suppliers tend to set the price amongst themselves. I whent to a computer show andone of the venders was from Texas and his prices were 30%-40% less. WhenI asked him why he venomently replied that all vendors exept him becausehe was from the states, had a meeting before the show and then began to price fix item by item everything that was for sale. And you know he wasright, you could go from table to table and get the exact price for eachthing.  Just goes to show that in the states they try to sell things at a small profit(just enough to make a living) Up gher they try to rob youblind and make the money quick. Just go to the mall and pick a few item out and jot down thier price. In just a few short weeks the price has   drop almost 70% or more. My mom whent out to White rose and saw a place mat for Holloween, for $39 well she went out again the day befor        Holloween and it was priced at $3.00 !!!!!!!!  So as you can see it's   the store owner and suppliers that like to screw you as much as posible . My motto is know the going price and if you see it at a low price thenbuy it. It's really sad...                                              hey bill how about a cheap 486/33 where would you go to get one in a    good price plus i need a laptop 286 would be great i only need a small  hard drive say 20 megs and a 3 1/2 drive give me a call                                                  ######     #    ######  #    #          #####     ##    #####   #    #  #     #   # #   #     # #   #           #    #   #  #   #    #  #   #   #     #  #   #  #     # #  #            #    #  #    #  #    #  ####    ######  #     # ######  ###       BBS   #    #  ######  #####   #  #    #       ####### #   #   #  #            #    #  #    #  #   #   #   #   #       #     # #    #  #   #           #####   #    #  #    #  #    #  #       #     # #     # #    #                                                         NEW NUMBER! ->  886-6224Featuring:                                                                              Public access Internet!

I currently run two Novellnetworks which are not directly connected.  Both networks have dial in  acces.                                                                  Is it possible / (or supported) for Pegasus E-mail to be pooled at      regular                                                                 intervals on one network, and delivered to the appropriate users on     the other network.  Has anyone found a solution to this problem (or is  it just too ovious)?

Great someone with some taste!  Pearl Jam, Soundgarden etc.. are great  groups.  You ask what concerts anyone has been too lately?  Well the    last one I was at was the Metallica/Guns N' Roses/Faith No More concert that was cancelled at the CNE.  The concert before that was the         Metallica concert in Hamilton.  I guess you got the idea that I like    Metallica, actually I'm one of their biggest fans.  I would have leved  to go see any Ozzy concert(from what Mark Longo says there is one today and I'm not there) Other groups I like are Pantera, Megadeth, White     Lion, Tesla, Guns N' Roses, Def Leppard, Extreme etc..........

When I left Europe, the ST and Amiga were only for the rich people, samewith IBM and clones... Sinclair and Commodore were just beginning to    phase out.Philips and Sony were trying to start a european/japanese     standard for home computers with the MSX-1 and later MSX-2 series of    computers. Different makes, different options, but completely compatibleas far as software goes. I guess it was their answer to                 IBM/Tandy/Zenith, but for 1/10 of the price. I can't figure out what    happened to them over here; nobody's ever heard of MSX... As for old    computers: my Spectrum right now controls my train set... 7 engines, 53 cars, about 200m of track, traffic lights and everything. All in N scale(9mm)... Took me a while to get the electronics right and write the     program, but the computer knows the position of every train to within 20cm, what cars are where, and avoids collisions. I started it on the     Timex 1000 (ZX81), but 16K wasn't enough... Quite amazing what can be   done in 48K though. I still can't figure out why paperboy  on my ZX     Spectrum (which is about 37K) is better, faster and has better graphics than the one for my XT, which is 340K, and has access to twice the speedand better graphics capabilities. Same goes for Bombjack and Bubble     Bobble. As for what the point of this message is: I don't know, I'm justblabbering a bit 'cause I'm bored.

And I do agree the atari disk drive is  way faster!  I bought it used and sold it a few months later for twice  what I paid for.  I talked to a guy a the new radio shack store up a    fairview, he told me that the newest  atari is compareable to the newer amiga 600. The two brands have a solid core of followers that are       totally devoted. The games on the amiga are great and the p boards seem to get the games quickly. So the machines are mostly game/computer      systems instead of IBM's being computers that can play games.           Chow for now..

Anyway, What do you mean by "Super" XT 4.88-10 MHz. I have a 4 yearold XT/286, which is an 8 bit computer using the 286, and is basically a22MHz XT.... Cost me $75... Anyway, I am interested in a price quote on tower cases (and power supply for them), along with description (ie,    desktop/full size, number of drive bays (important!) and front display  (ie: turbo LED, or digital speed readout). Also in larger MFM and RLL   harddisks (80Meg or more for MFM, 120MB or more for RLL), along with    price, access speed, size, height, brand/model number. Also Can you get a pair of BIOS chips for a DTK 16MHz 386SX motherboard usingm the       solutions (micro solutions?) chipset? If so, how much? (Dated April '91 or later if possible, earlier AMI BIOS chips may not be compatible with OS/2).                                                                                                          Marcel                          How compatible are the Amiga 500 and Atari ST? I remember that when I   bought Empire (Wargame of the Century) for the Amiga, the same disk     could also be used for the ST... By the way, I also have it for the IBM,and although most of the game is over 20 times faster, scrolling the    screen even just 1 square takes over 2 seconds... Guess that fancy Amigabit operations coprocessor comes in handy with games/screen output.

KNOW THE GAME INSIDE OUT            ANY QUESTIONS                                                           I am looking for a 386-sx motherboard !  I require 2 megs of RAM and    will purchasing the board within the next 3 weeks !  Please call Cheers BBS at 624-1114 and drop a line to the SysOp !  Much appreciated !      I dont know to much about the atari compatible with Amiga so your one upon me there. One game I had had awsome vertical scrolling wth amazing   graphics, Ive not see the like on the IBM's. Im waiting to see the next breed of IBM computers that will have more built in features like the   Amiga.                                                                  As usual our esteemed government has once again fumbled the ball.       Allowing more companies to offer long distance service is great, it's   too bad that they can't play on an even field. For over 10 years        companies like UNITEL (cncp telecommunications and rogers cable) have   been laying fiber optic cable all across this country. Now they can showtheir technology. The sad part is that once again millions of taxpayers dollars are being spent trying to save BELL's monopoly. To use any otherlong distance carrier you will have to dial 16 digits instead of the    regular 10. Poor BELL, I guess they'll have to raise our local rates nowthat we can see how much cheaper it is to go elsewhere for long         distance.    MAYBE THERE IS A SANTA CLAUSE                                                                           nah.........               For the music lover in you.

RASO                                 Actually, you have to dial an extra 17 digits before your long distance number to use a reseller, but, with a memory phone or a Mitel autodialerthis can be done is seconds without inconvenience.  I use STN (a        reseller) for my long distance modem transmissions and it works         terrific!  As for local rates going up, I think the CRTC is restricting Bell's ability to raise those rates through the use of "contribution    charges" that resellers must pay to Bell to keep local calling rates    subsidized.  So, the contribution charges are keeping the cost of local calls down, but, the reason that Bell is griping is that its            profitability is being challenged, even though the 2 Top 1000           revenue-earning companies in Canada are Bell Canada (ontario) and BCE   Inc. (Bell Canada Enterprises in Quebec).  That is why Bell has been    groaning and threatening rate jumps for local calling ...idle threats!  It may be a good Christmas after all...maybe there REALLY is a Santa    Claus!  :-)                                                             Jason Sack                                                              Now you can pay a monthly fee of either $29.95 or $39.95 and receive    either 300 long distance minutes at 10 cents per minute or 600 long     distance minutes at 7 cents per minutes to most major centers in Ontario(and Montreal too!) and their local calling areas by using STN, Smart   Talk Network.

I have found it to be useful and hasn't caused me any problems with compatibilty etc. I have a shareware version of it (I think it is version 1.5, not sure  though).  If you are interested and haven't found one somewhere else,   let me know and I will upload it for you.                                                                                                       Greg Allt                                                               An IBM with more features built in will never happen. You'd lose the    compatibility and upgradeability. An IBM with EGA can easily be upgradedto VGA, SVGA, or XGA. Buy a soundcard, and when a better one comes out  get it. Same with everything else. Now tell me how easy it is to upgradethe video capabilities of an Amiga? How about sound? One thing that IBM compatibles need is a soundcard with the capabilities of the Amiga (ie: 2 adc's per channel or more), and capable of DMA, with it's own memory  (1MB isn't that expensive anymore) on top of that. Now why has nobody   made something like that? I'd do it myself if I had the capability to   cheaply make multilayered PC boards.                                    I wish to purchase 4 - 1 meg Simms (70 ns or better).  Have to trade, anAamazing paperwhite VGA monitor, sever 720K disk drives, a 1200 and a   2400 external modem, cables, software, etc. etc. What do you have and   how Much?                                                               I have a handheld Radio Shack Scanner (Pro-34) for sale.  Best offer.   Receives plane, police, fire, ambulance, city, cellular telephones, etc.Just wondering if I could get validated. I am a student at conestoga    college and I enjoy bbsing. I am currently on several other boards      including sharetime, spark 5, rgb, edge of reality and telemax.                 Later, dean.                                                                                                                          hi, can I be validated???? Also, do you have any disk catalogging       programs on this bbs????                                                i can get you a brand new IDE.  from the manufacturer. or better yet.   get a SyQuest removable.                                                if u are intrested. just post me a note.                                maybe i can get you one straicht from the manufacturer.                 the old atari yes was pretty comparable to the c=64. i have the newer.  one. it is nice.. and fast too. i am probabally going to upgrade my st  to a mega ste.. or a TT030. which is comparable to an apple macintosh.  the Amiga 500 is not compadable to the Atari st. my friend is got an    amiga 500 and i got an ST. he loaned me a disk that he formatted on his system so i gan get him an amiga game i had  (i downloaded it for him)  and i could not Copy it.                                                the processor and processor speed is the same. but the ST's disk access speed is faster                                                         sx25 or sx33. i can get a 25 for 150 and a 33 for 210. if you want to   order one. drop me a line.                                              the amiga and ST i think can get  some art programs that can display    4096 colors. and i think there is a board than can display 10 million   colors.costs alot though                                                i can get the cases with 2 drive bays and led display ranging in size   from desktop to full tower each with a 200W power supply                i can also get the hard drives. i don't got prices yet. i gotta call themanufacturer.                                                           Sultan, did ya hear the latest.  Macho Man and MR. Perfect as tag-team  partners, Hmmmmm.  I smell a double crossing.                           The Amiga has the capability to display 4096 colors, but only 16 of themat a time in hi-res mode, or 32 in lo-res mode. I don't know about the  10 million. As for the IBM: most come with VGA now, which gives you 16  out of 262,144 at a 1024x768 resolution, or 256 out of 262,144 at       800x600. Now to compare with the 10,000, you'd get a Targa true color   display card with true 32 bit colors... More than 4,000,000, the only   limit of how many can be displayed at a time is the number of dots on   the screen (each dot a different color.)                                Only 2 drive bays? That's 2 of my floppy drives! I need ad leat 8,      preferably 10 half height bays, at least 4 of which must be able to be  used as 2 full height ones... I have 3 floppy drives, and a full sized  hard drive. I will probably add a CD-ROM and another full height drive  in the future... And maybe a tape backup.                               BTW, what kind of case is that anyway? Even the original XT cases, as   well as the smallest desktop tower cases I've seen come with at least 4.(drive bays that it.)                                                   Just by the fact that BELL shares have not really moved on the markets  lets you know that they will soon recieve a little help from our        esteemed democratic (who the hell am I kidding) government. You can bet there will be a new tax impossed on all users of BELL equipment. This   will be set to help BELL pay for repairs to their over-used equipment.  In reality we all know that BELL will find a way to write off capitol   expenditures and upgrade their equipment at the expense of the other    long distance companies. We all know that in the long run who will end  up paying don't we.                                                             I guess the book would be called:                                               "THE CHIN THAT STOLE CHRISTMAS"                         Well, you see the Ultra accelerates, but the chip (the mach) is         programmable and therefore is not considered a graphics accelator but   instead a co-pro card.  GA's do not have that ability, only have the    bitblt and other such operations built into the card.                   Thanks I will.  Wow its been a while since I have been BBSing.  Its     amazing how time flies when you actually do work.                       Hi Mark. I'm interested in getting into the computer mail system. I do  not have much experience (alright zero experience) at this stuff. So farI have been uploading/downloadinf files on other boards. I need to know more about the software avalible to handle email and probably need to   improve my spelling etc. Anyway, if you think I'm trainable I would likethe opertunity to learn from this BBS. About me. I'm the father of 3. A good metallurgist, really enjoy computer games of all kinds. Alwasy     ready to learn a something knew. Can't type or spell well at all!!      I'll check with you next week.                                          Pete...                                                                 I don't own any oil compamies but; hydrogen powered cars are not        safe!you do not need bateries for elec(whatever) the problem lies with  storing hydrogen.If a person were to be in volved in a rearend colision with a hydrogen car .... barbequed road piza comes to mind. if you dont belive me just ask the captain of the hindenberg how volitile hydrogen  is.... autos powerd by h would need PREASURIZED cell of the stuf        I do like the idea of perfect combustion however perfection is an       immeasureable quality.                                                  Okay then, you tell me WHICH boards you consider accelerators. If a     co=processed board is faster than a normal board, and has more          capabilities built in than what you call an accelerator because it is   programmable whereas an accelerator isn't, I call it an accelerator. Are                                                                        Basically you are telling me that an electronic fuel injection system   that can handle both gasoline and nitro is not a fuel injection system, because the original ones didn't have the capability to adjust to       different pressure and air/fuel ratio needed for nitro... Also, we were talking about so-called "windows accelerator video boards", ALL of whichare co-processed! Or are you calling a good old-fashioned VGA Wonder an accelerator because it is faster than the original IBM VGA card?        Ohhhhhh yeeeeaaaahhh !  Double X'ssing is a definate plan !  maybe the  perfect plan !  Well, we;ll se tonite Bud, Macho in virtually a 3 on 1  bout !                                                                  Does this include the 2 megs RAM i need !  If so, a done deal !!!!!!    Thank You !                                                             I read bulletin #1 but am still unsure on the question of cost.  Is     there any?  I am a student at Waterloo in first year Environmental      Science.  I am interested in seeing what this system is all about.  Is  it simply a place to advertise things or is there more to it?           That is all for now.  Shaun Richards.                                   Hmmm I am not sure if Gene Wolfe has written any more. I seem to recall he has but not necessarily in the fantasy genera. Have you read         neuromancer?

I was wonder is there anyone out there who is as great a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien as I am?  I would be interested in communicating with any Tolkien fans out there.  The man is the best fantasy writer ever so if you have any opinions feel free to drop me a line.                   Has anyone seen aladin or Home Alone II, are they any good.
