                              Boss File Structures
12                           --------------------

  Boss bbs was compiled using Qbasic 3.0.   The file structures used by
Boss are given below.  These structures were thought up by myself [Mark Longo]
so they are not compatible with any other BBS utility programs.  I  have
decided to put them on line in the hopes that some people might create some
good utility programs for Boss!

File Name:  USERS.BBS  Length Of Each Record = 190 Bytes
15
  This file holds all user information.
11
    Description           # of Bytes       Details or Example
12 -----------           ----------       ------------------
10 First Name               19
    Last Name                19
    Password                 15
    City                     19
    Data Phone               12
    Voice Phone              12
    Ansi                     1             Y or N
    Birth Date               10            XX-XX-XXXX
    Screen Length            2             10-66
    Security Level           5             Integer
    Times Called             5
    High Message Read        5
    Time Used                4             Minutes
    Times Posted             5
    Last Call                10            XX-XX-XXXX
    Number Of Uploads        5
    Uploads in Bytes         7
    Number Of Downloads      5
    Downloads in Bytes       7
    Screen Clearing          1             Y or N
    User Deleted             1             1 = Yes
12                          ----
14             Total        169
11
    Remember the total length of each record is 190 Bytes.  190-169=21 FREE
    Bytes at the end of each USER record.  These are there in case I wish to
    add additional data at a later date.

    The very first record HOLDS the number of users.  This record is also
    190 bytes in length.
14
File Name:  LASTREAD.BBS
15
  This file holds the last read message pointers for each base.
11
  5 Bytes, 20 Fields per record.
12
  Each N user's last read pointers will be located at N-1 in the LASTREAD.BBS
  file. For example:  User #234's lastread message pointers will be found at
  record 233.  I don't feel like going into a LONG explanation about this, so
  if it confuses you ... tough!

14
File Name: HEADER.BBS  LEN=125
15
  This file holds the HEADER of a message.
11
    Description           # of Bytes       Details or Example
12 -----------           ----------       ------------------

12 -----------                      ----------
10 Message Number                       5

    Start Location in MESSAGE.BBS        10
    End Location in MESSAGE.BBS          10
12                                      ----
14                         Total        30

11
    The very first record holds the NUMBER of messages in the system.
    It is also 30 bytes in size.
14
File Name: MESSAGE.BBS  LEN=72
15
  This file holds the guts of a message.
11
    Description                # of Bytes       Details or Example
12 -----------                ----------       ------------------
10 Message Guts                   72
12                               ----

How Do The Message Bases Work?
------------------------------
14

  Now, what does all this stuff mean?  I will try and sum it up below:

  a) When you wish to view a BOSS message, you scan the HEADER file
     for the message you want.

  b) Once you have found the header you want,  read its index data
     from INDEX.BBS.  The record # for the index file will be ONE
     more than the header record #.  Ex: Header #23's index record
     will be #24.  Confusing ... not really!

  c) Once you have read the values for the starting and ending locations
     from INDEX.BBS you can read the GUTS of the message from MESSAGE.BBS
     Simply read from that starting and ending record!

10

  I realize that there is some 'useless' data in the message files.  This
is there simply because I have some more PLANS for the message bases that
have yet to be implemented.  I hope this file helps you out.

  If you have any questions or need help, drop me a message!
