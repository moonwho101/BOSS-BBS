      2)   You are allowed to distribute your unregistered DS copy  to
           as  many  people  as you like,  in fact  it  is  encouraged.
           However,  if you do so,  all files must be in there original
           state, they cannot be altered.  You must also make sure that
           every  file that belongs to DS is included in  the  archive,
           none can be deleted.  Please respect this request.


      3)   In  no way can you profit from the distribution  of  Dungeon
           Stompers.


      2.01  System Requirements
      -------------------------

        Dungeon  Stompers will run as long as there is at least 250k of
      free memory.  This is the minimium requirement.  Please note that
      you  need at least 320K of free memory if you wish DS to run  its
      own events.  (See: Setup Procedures 3.01)  If you have less  than
      320K  avialable  there will not be enough memory for DS to  shell
      and run the events.  This means you will have to take care of the
      events from your BBS program.

        It  is possible to run DS on a floppy system but I have yet  to
      hear  from anyone who has,  let me know if you are able to run it
      from floppy or a RAM drive.


      2.02  Dungeon Stomper Archive
      -----------------------------

        When you recieve Dungeon Stompers you should be given one large
      archive entitled, `STOMP.ARC'.  Inside this archive will be three
      more archives entitled:

             STOMPER.ARC
             IPASSER.ARC
             READPCB.ARC


        If  you  are missing  any   of these,  you have  an  incomplete
      version, please inform the person you recieved it from.


      3.00  Installing The Program
      ----------------------------

        The  first step to installing DS is to make its own  directory.
      Unarc  all the files in this area (STOMPER.ARC,  IPASSER.ARC  and
      READPCB.ARC).   You are now ready to run the set procedure below.

      DUNGEON STOMPERS Ver 1.02                           April 24,1989

      3.01  Set Up Procedure
      ----------------------

        Please  follow these procedures to the letter as setting up  DS
      can be tricky the first time!


      1)     Execute  the  program RESET.EXE.  This will prepare DS for
           the setup.

      2)   Now  run  SETUP.EXE,   you will see a SysOp menu  with  many
           options.    Choose  Option `B'.   The program will ask you a
           series   of  questions.    Please  follow   them  with   the
           descriptions below.



      --->   Enter Time for each Turn {100}:

             This is the number of `turns' a player can make each MOVE.



      --->   Enter Starting Gold {25}:

             This will be the amount of gold the players start with.



      --->   Enter The Number of times a player can play a day: {2}

             This is the number of times a player can use his turns per
             day.   For example,  if you set number of turns to 100 and
             number of moves to 2 then the player will be able to  play
             100 turns twice a day.



      --->   SysOps Name {Your Name}:

             Enter your full name here.



      --->   After how many players should the dungeon restock {4}:

             This  will  restock the dungeon after a certain number  of
             people have entered the game.  You should keep this number
             fairly low so that the dungeon does not become  empty.   A
             value between 4-8 is usually good.





                                      - 4 -








      DUNGEON STOMPERS Ver 1.02                           April 24,1989

      --->   Do you have a colour monitor {N}:

             If you have a colour monitor, and you answer `yes' to this
             question, you will see brilliant colour ALL the time, even
             if the player does not have ANSI turned on!


      --->   Delay for timeout {6000}:

             This value varies from computer to computer.   This is the
             check to make sure the user has not left the game sitting.


             If  the person does not type something within  this  delay
             time a `Time out for user inactivity' will occur , logging
             the  player  off.   The higher the number the  longer  the
             delay.  6000 works perfect for most IBM XT compatibles.


      --->   Can your BBS pass time remaining {Y}:


             If  your  BBS  creates  a file  which  contains  the  time
             remaining of a user then answer yes to this question.


      --->   Should DS run its own events {Y}:


             If  you have more than 320K free memory for DS then answer
             `Yes' to this question.   As soon as a DATE change  occurs
             DS will shell out and run EVENTS.BAT.   If you do not have
             enough  memory for the shell,  you must run the EVENTS.BAT
             from your BBS.

      Note:   The  settings listed above work correctly with an IBM  XT
              Compatible  computer running QBBS,  PCBoard  or  WILDCAT.
              If you have a different system ,  you may have to  adjust
              these parameters.


      3)   Now choose option `A' and set the dungeon size to 30 by  20.
           Remeber  ,  you can never make the dungeon smaller in  size,
           only bigger!

      4)    Now  choose  option  `E' and press  return  until  you  see
            `INSERTING...'.   This  will insert some pre-made wandering
            monsters.


      5)    Now choose option `L'.  This will exit the set up menu.




                                      - 5 -








      DUNGEON STOMPERS Ver 1.02                           April 24,1989

        Dungeon Stompers is now ready to be executed.   Follow the next
      procedure (IPASSER 4.00) to set up DS for your BBS.


      4.00 IPASSER
      ------------

         Ipasser is contained within the IPASSER archive.  This program
      was  created by Paul Filsinger for the purpose of converting most
      major BBS door information files into a Dungeon Stomper  standard
      file.

          Those  who are using PCBoard may wish to use READPCB.EXE over
      IPASSER,  as  READPCB displays a very nice BUSY  message,   which
      IPASSER  does not do.  Either way, both IPASSER and READPCB  will
      work on multiple nodes on PCBoard.  It is up to you which one you
      use.  The documentation needed to run READPCB is contained within
      the  ARCHIVE as it is a utility.    READPCB was created by  David
      Pletsch of Hillside Systems.


         Before  any explaination is give about Ipasser ,   you  should
      become  familiar  with  the  file DS will  be  reading  for  User
      Information.    This  file is entitled DS.DEF,  its format is  as
      follows:

                Users first name
                Users second name
                Ansi (Y/N)
                Time Remaining


       All letters MUST be in capital letters.

        As  long as your BBS program creates a file that contains  that
      information , you can run DS.


      4.01  Ipasser Explained
      -----------------------

        Ipasser  will  read the door information files created  by  the
      following BBS's:

                      PCBoard Ver 14
                      QuickBBS
                      Wildcat
                      Phoenix


        Once  Ipasser has read the door information,  it will  copy  it
      into  DS.DEF using the format of the file given  above.   Ipasser
      will also write to these other DS files:


                                      - 6 -








      DUNGEON STOMPERS Ver 1.02                           April 24,1989

                       COM.DAT :  Communication Port Used
                      BAUD.DAT :  Callers baud rate


      4.02 Ipasser Commands
      ---------------------

        The format for the IPASSER.EXE program is as follows:

               IPASSER filename.ext



            Where filename.ext is a file in the following format:

        COMPORT: #       {Optional}  : Over rides comport passed by bbs
                                       and uses the # specified instead
                                       (ie. COMPORT: 1)


        NODIRECT         {Optional}  : Turns direct screen  writes  off
                                       (Uses BIOS)

        NOCOLOR          {Optional}  : Turns Ipasser colour off.

        BBS SOFTWARE     {Mandatory} : Is one of the following

                                         QuickBBS :  QuickBBS
                                         Phoenix  :  Phoenix BBS
                                         Wildcat  :  Wildcat BBS
                                         Pcb14    :  PCBoard 14

        BBSPATH:  path   {Mandatory} :  The  path of  the  BBS,  with
                                        a trailing slash (ie. c:\bbs\)

        DOORPATH: path   {Mandatory} :  The path of DS, with a trailing
                                        slash (ie c:\bbs\stomp\)

        TIMELIMIT: In minutes        :  This will over  ride  the  time
                         {Optional}     remaining passed  from BBS , in
                                        case  the SysOp wants to put  a
                                        limit on the door.
                                        (ie TIMELIMT:30)

          Lets call our Ipasser information file, IPASSER.CFG.  Here is
      what a typical one would look like:


          PCB14
          BBSPATH:  c:\bbs\
          DOORPATH: c:\bbs\stomp\




                                      - 7 -








      DUNGEON STOMPERS Ver 1.02                           April 24,1989

        And  thats all there is to it!   Ipasser will do everything for
      you!   Other BBS programs will be added,  so call the DS  support
      board for updates.



      4.03   Other Boards
      -------------------

         If  Ipasser  does  not support the BBS software that  you  are
      running then you will have to write your own passing routine.   I
      have  included a very simple `Bare Bones' program that is a  very
      good example for writing such routines.   The program is entitled
      PASS.BAS.   Be  sure  to write to the DS.DEF file  in  the  exact
      format given above.

         If your BBS does not create a door file at all, then I suggest
      that  you look into some better software,   as a door file is  an
      essential part to most BBS's.


      5.00  Running DS from the door (Single node)
      --------------------------------------------

        You will now have to edit the DS.BAT to suit your system.  Once
      your  BBS  has dropped or shelled to DOS you should  invoke  this
      batch  file.    Here is a typical DS.BAT used to run the  Dungeon
      Stomper game (with the use of Ipasser ,  to pass door information
      of course.):

            ECHO OFF
            CD\BBS\STOMP           : Switch to DS directory
            IPASSER IPASSER.CFG    : Run Ipasser using Ipasser.cfg
            LOGON                  : Start Dungeon Stompers
            CD\BBS                 : Return to BBS directory.
            EXIT                   : Exit the batch file

          IPASSER.CFG contains:

          QuickBBS
          BBSPATH: c:\bbs\
          DOORPATH: c:\bbs\stomp\


         And thats all it takes to run DS from a single node!

      5.01  Running DS on Multi-Node System (2 or more nodes)
      -------------------------------------------------------

        WARNING:   Dungeon Stompers cannot be run on a multinode system
                   at  the  same  time as the data  files  will  become
                   corrupt!

      DUNGEON STOMPERS Ver 1.02                           April 24,1989

        Ipasser  can  still be used with nodes ,  because of the  handy
      command line option:

               IPASSER IPASSER.ND1

        This allows you to tell passer where each door information file
      is  located.  You can create a IPASSER file for each node!

        The  following  example demonstrates how to run DS on a  multi-
      node  system.   The Batch file is complete with BUSY  signal  and
      is pretty self explanatory.


          ECHO OFF
          CD\BBS\STOMP                :Change to Stomp Directory
          IF EXIST BUSY GOTO BUSY     :If another node using, get away!
          IPASSER IPASSER.ND1         :See Below!
          COPY DS.DEF BUSY            :Create Busy File
          LOGON                       :Start DS
          DEL BUSY                    :Done, get rid of Busy signal
          CD\BBS\NODE1                :Return to correct node area
          EXIT
          :BUSY
          ECHO Game Busy >com1        :Tells user stomp is in use
          CD\BBS\NODE1                :Return to correct node area
          EXIT


         The file IPASSER would contain the following:

          PCB14
          BBSPATH: c:\bbs\node1\
          DOORPATH: c:\bbs\stomp\


         Study  the batch closely.   If you continue to have  problems,
      contact the Dungeon Stomper support board.


      6.00  Monitoring Carrier
      ------------------------

        Dungeon  Stompers will monitor the communications port in  case
      someone  hangs up.   If a hang up occurs the player's  name,  the
      time  and  the  date they hung up will be  written  to  the  file
      HANG.DAT.   Dungeon  Stompers will then save any information that
      needs to be saved then will return back to the system (where  the
      batch  file that is running DS will take over.)

         Dungeon  Stompers monitors the communications port as  follows
      (using the BASIC INP command):

         For COM1:


                                      - 9 -








      DUNGEON STOMPERS Ver 1.02                           April 24,1989

              IF INP(&H3FE)<127 then a hang up has occurred.


         For COM2:

              IF INP(&H2FE)<127 then a hang up has occurred.

        Basically, if a value of 126 or less is returned the player has
      hung up.  Thus causing DS to return to the system.


         If,  for  some  reason ,  this does not seem to work  on  your
      system,   you can EDIT the file entitled MDM.DEF to a value of 0.
      This will turn communication port checking off.   But be  warned,
      if  a  player  hangs up and you have turned  communications  port
      checking off,  your system will hang!


      7.00  Events
      ------------

        Dungeon Stompers must run its events each day.   If DS is going
      to  run  its  own events (ie you answered `Y' to this  option  in
      option  `B' of SETUP) then you must make sure that EVENTS.BAT  is
      contained in the DS directory.   Dungeon Stompers will run  these
      events  each day (as long as you have 320K of free memory for the
      shell!).

         If you answered `No' to `Should DS run its own events' in part
      `B' of setup then you must make your BBS run  the   files  listed
      below  once  everyday.   The files must be executed in the  order
      listed below or errors will result.

             DS-MAIN
             EVENT2
             CLEAN
             CLEAN2
             MON
             EVENT
             ORDER

        All these files must be run at least once a day!

      8.00  Executable Utilities
      --------------------------

        The executable utilities are SETUP, EDITOR and MAP.

      DUNGEON STOMPERS Ver 1.02                           April 24,1989

               Key                                    Function

             Ctrl  A                                Up one user
             Ctrl  S                                Down one user
             Ctrl  Q                                Quit, don't save
             Ctrl  W                                Quit and save


      8.03   The Map
      --------------

        This  is   a  little     utility that only the SysOp  can  use.
      Running  the program MAP.EXE will give the SysOp an overhead view
      of the Dungeon.   This is usefull in determining how crowded  the
      area is becoming.   If the area is becoming to crowded,  increase
      the dungeon size.

      9.00  Files You can edit
      ------------------------

      9.01  Chron.dat
      ---------------

        This is the `NEWS' file that is displayed right after the title
      screen.   Use your favourite editor to put any announcements that
      you wish your users to see in this file.

      9.02  Macro.dat
      ---------------

        This  file  contains  the Words that will be  assigned  to  the
      function  keys  F2 to F10.   DS will load the words in this  file
      when  executed.    Pressing the function keys in Chat  mode  will
      display  these words.    The file MUST contain 9 words one  after
      the other or a error will result.   The F1 key holds the  SysOp's
      Name.

      9.03  Monster.dat
      -----------------

        This is the file which contains wandering monsters that you can
      create.   You  can create any kind of monster you wish as long as
      you  NEVER repeat any of the monsters names in  this  file.   The
      format for the file is as follows:

            Monster Name
            Status
            Armour (5-20)

        Once  you  have created your monsters,  simply run  the  INSERT
      WANDERING MONSTERS routine in the SETUP program.  This will place
      them in the dungeon.   A typical monster file may look like this:



                                      - 13 -








      DUNGEON STOMPERS Ver 1.02                           April 24,1989

             Orc
             17
             9
             Red Dragon
             99
             20

        Just  let your imagination go,  the more creative you are  with
      the monster file,  the more enjoyable the game is.   There in  no
      limit on the number of monsters you can insert into the dungeon.


      10.00  Error.log
      ----------------

        If  an  error results in DS (horrors of horrors!)  it  will  be
      recorded in a log entitled ERROR.LOG.  If an error does occur the
      user will be told to inform the SysOp immediately.  If you cannot
      hunt  down  the error,  i suggest running RESET.EXE and  starting
      fresh,  or  you  could  always  call the  DS  support  Board  for
      assistance.


      11.00  Chat Mode
      ----------------

         Pressing  the  ESC key in DS will engage the chat  mode.   You
      cannot engage in CHAT when a player is writing a message or  when
      the character is fighting.

      11.01  Chat mode functions
      --------------------------
